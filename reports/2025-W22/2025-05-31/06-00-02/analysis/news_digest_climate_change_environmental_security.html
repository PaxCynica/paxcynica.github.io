  <h2>Analyst’s Guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Closely monitor the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events globally.  See <a href="https://time.com/7289719/hundred-year-weather-events-happen-more-often/">Time Magazine's article</a> for context.</li>
    <li>Assess the vulnerability of communities in mountainous regions to glacier melt and related geohazards.  Refer to reports on the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cn4q127y7y8o">Swiss village of Blatten</a> for specific examples.</li>
    <li>Track the development of climate-related litigation against fossil fuel companies.  The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/30/nx-s1-5416766/climate-change-lawsuit-oil-companies">NPR article</a> provides a starting point.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of global climate mitigation efforts and identify areas for improvement.  Consider the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simithambi/2025/05/30/how-the-current-tariff-tug-of-war-is-impacting-climate-adaptation/">impact of tariffs on climate adaptation</a>.</li>
    <li>Analyze the socioeconomic consequences of climate change and develop strategies for addressing the needs of vulnerable populations.</li>
