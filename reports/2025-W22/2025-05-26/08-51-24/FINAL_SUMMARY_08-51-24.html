        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Geopolitical tensions are escalating across multiple fronts, demanding careful monitoring. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine witnesses intensified Russian attacks, even amidst prisoner exchanges, indicating a potentially prolonged and brutal phase. Simultaneously, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to fuel a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, marked by significant civilian casualties and allegations of war crimes, further destabilizing the region.</p>
        <p>Economically, the US-China trade war persists, creating uncertainty in global markets and forcing nations to reassess alliances and supply chain strategies. President Trump's potential tariff impositions add another layer of complexity, threatening to disrupt international trade and strain relations with key partners. These economic pressures are driving a focus on reshoring and supply chain security, particularly in strategic sectors like semiconductors.</p>
        <p>Technological advancements, particularly in AI, are rapidly transforming industries and raising both opportunities and challenges. While AI offers potential for innovation and economic growth, ethical concerns regarding job displacement, bias, and misuse are growing. The need for proactive regulation and responsible AI development is becoming increasingly urgent as AI becomes more deeply integrated into our lives.</p>
