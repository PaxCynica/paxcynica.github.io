          <div class="scenario-title">Nvidia Dominates (High Probability <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">70%</span>)</div>
          <p>Nvidia maintains its leading position, securing over 75% market share by 2028.  This scenario is driven by continued innovation in AI chip architecture (e.g., significant advancements beyond Blackwell), successful penetration of the Chinese market despite export restrictions, and strong investor confidence.  Quantifiable indicators include Nvidia's stock price exceeding $500, consistent year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 30%, and a significant increase in global AI chip manufacturing capacity controlled by Nvidia or its partners. Key assumptions include continued US-China technological decoupling and sustained high demand for AI processing power.</p>
          <p>Consequences:  Potential for increased market concentration, potentially leading to higher prices and reduced competition. Nvidia could exert significant influence on the direction of AI development globally.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Competitive Landscape (Medium Probability <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">20%</span>)</div>
          <p>Nvidia maintains a significant lead but faces stronger competition from Intel and AMD. This scenario is driven by Intel and AMD's successful development of competitive AI chips, increased investment in R&D, and potential shifts in geopolitical alliances that ease export restrictions. Quantifiable indicators include Nvidia's market share between 55% and 75%, a slowdown in Nvidia's revenue growth to 15-20% year-over-year, and increased market share for Intel and AMD in specific niche segments. Key assumptions include breakthroughs in chip manufacturing technology that level the playing field and a relaxation of US-China trade tensions.</p>
          <p>Consequences:  A more balanced market with increased innovation and potentially lower prices for consumers.  However, the potential for rapid technological shifts could create market volatility.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Nvidia's Lead Challenged (Low Probability <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">10%</span>)</div>
          <p>Nvidia's market dominance is significantly challenged, with its share falling below 55% by 2028. This scenario is driven by unforeseen technological disruptions, a major shift in global geopolitical alliances favoring China, and a significant decrease in demand for high-end AI processing power. Quantifiable indicators include a significant drop in Nvidia's stock price, a decline in revenue, and increased market share for both Intel and AMD, potentially including a significant breakthrough by Chinese manufacturers. Key assumptions include a major technological leap by a competitor, a significant change in global economic conditions, and a substantial decrease in demand for AI.</p>
          <p>Consequences:  Market instability, potential for job losses in the AI chip sector, and a significant reshaping of the global technology landscape.  The future direction of AI development could be significantly altered.</p>
