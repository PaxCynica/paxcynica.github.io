        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Geopolitical tensions continue to escalate across multiple fronts, demanding close monitoring. The conflict in Gaza remains a severe humanitarian crisis, drawing increasing international condemnation and raising the specter of potential sanctions against Israel. Simultaneously, the war in Ukraine intensifies, marked by unprecedented Russian aerial attacks and uncertain Western support, with potential shifts in US policy under a possible return of the Trump administration. The rapid advancement of AI, while promising, raises ethical and security concerns, particularly regarding military applications and energy consumption.</p>

        <p>Economically, global markets face continued uncertainty due to unpredictable trade policies and shifting supply chains. Concerns over China's influence in critical sectors, such as semiconductors, are driving nations to seek greater self-reliance. The energy sector remains volatile, with fluctuating oil prices and the rise of resource nationalism impacting global markets. These factors, coupled with climate change impacts on agriculture and water resources, pose significant challenges to food security and economic stability.</p>

        <p>Domestically, many nations face growing political polarization and civil unrest, fueled by disinformation and concerns over election integrity. The legacy of George Floyd continues to spark debate and highlight systemic issues of racism and police brutality. These internal divisions, coupled with external pressures, create a complex and challenging environment for governments worldwide.</p>
