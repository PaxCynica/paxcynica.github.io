    <h2>Implications & Significance</h2>
    <div class="policy-implications">
      <h3>Policy Options</h3>
      <p>Several policy options exist to address the escalating conflict:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Diplomacy and Mediation:</strong> Increased engagement by the US and other international actors to facilitate dialogue and compromise between India and Pakistan. This could involve confidence-building measures and addressing underlying grievances.</li>
        <li><strong>Arms Control and Non-Proliferation:</strong>  International efforts to limit the proliferation of advanced weaponry in the region, particularly missiles. This would require cooperation from both India and Pakistan, as well as international pressure and incentives.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Sanctions:</strong>  Targeted sanctions against individuals or entities involved in fueling the conflict. This could deter further escalations, but carries the risk of unintended economic consequences and potential backlash.</li>
        <li><strong>Humanitarian Aid:</strong>  Provision of humanitarian assistance to affected populations. This is crucial to address immediate needs, but may not address the root causes of the conflict.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Effectiveness and Drawbacks</h3>
      <p>The effectiveness of each policy option depends on various factors, including the willingness of both India and Pakistan to cooperate, the level of international support, and the specific geopolitical context.  Each option carries potential drawbacks, including the risk of escalation, economic disruption, and unintended consequences. A comprehensive strategy that combines multiple approaches may be necessary to achieve lasting stability.</p>
