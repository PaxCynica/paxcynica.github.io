    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This report outlines three plausible future scenarios for the period 2025-2030, focusing on the interplay between global geopolitical instability and economic uncertainty.  These scenarios are driven by ongoing conflicts, technological advancements, and evolving power dynamics.  The most likely scenario involves a period of prolonged instability, characterized by regional conflicts, economic volatility, and increased competition for resources.  However, the potential for both positive and negative outcomes exists, depending on the actions taken by various actors.</p>

    <div class="scenarios">
      <div class="scenario-container">
        <div class="scenario scenario-high">
          <div class="scenario-title">Prolonged Instability <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (65%)</span></div>
          <p>This scenario projects a continuation of existing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. Regional conflicts persist, leading to volatile energy and food markets.  Technological advancements, particularly in AI and military capabilities, exacerbate existing power imbalances.  Global cooperation remains limited, hindering effective responses to shared challenges like climate change. Quantifiable indicators include sustained high oil prices (<span class="trend-up">>$120/barrel</span>), increased global food insecurity (<span class="trend-up">>10% increase in global hunger index</span>), and continued military spending increases (<span class="trend-up">>5% annual growth in global military expenditure</span>).</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Failure of peace negotiations in Ukraine and the Middle East; escalating tensions between major powers; continued climate change impacts; limited international cooperation.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Persistent regional conflicts; significant fluctuations in commodity prices; escalating rhetoric between major powers; failure of international agreements; increased refugee flows.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Current trends in geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty continue; major powers prioritize national interests over global cooperation; climate change impacts worsen; technological advancements are not effectively managed.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Prolonged economic instability; increased humanitarian crises; potential for wider conflicts; further erosion of global governance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Gradual Stabilization <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium (25%)</span></div>
          <p>In this scenario, diplomatic efforts yield some success, leading to a gradual de-escalation of tensions.  Economic recovery is slow but steady, driven by technological innovation and increased investment in renewable energy.  Global cooperation improves, facilitating more effective responses to shared challenges.  Quantifiable indicators include a gradual decline in oil prices (<span class="trend-down">to ~$90/barrel</span>), improvements in global food security (<span class="trend-down">5% decrease in global hunger index</span>), and a shift towards investment in renewable energy (<span class="trend-up">>10% annual growth in renewable energy investments</span>).</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Successful diplomatic resolutions to key conflicts; increased global cooperation; technological innovation driving economic growth; increased investment in renewable energy.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Decreased military activity in conflict zones; stabilization of commodity prices; increased international cooperation on climate change; growing investment in renewable energy; improved global economic indicators.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Major powers prioritize cooperation; diplomatic efforts succeed; technological innovation drives economic growth; climate change mitigation efforts show positive results.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Improved global stability; gradual economic recovery; increased global cooperation; reduced risk of major conflicts; progress on climate change.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Accelerated Crisis <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low (10%)</span></div>
          <p>This scenario depicts a rapid escalation of geopolitical tensions and economic collapse.  Major conflicts erupt, disrupting global supply chains and causing widespread economic devastation.  Technological advancements are misused, exacerbating existing inequalities and fueling conflict.  Global cooperation collapses, leading to a chaotic and unpredictable future.  Quantifiable indicators include a sharp increase in oil prices (<span class="trend-up">>$200/barrel</span>), widespread famine (<span class="trend-up">>20% increase in global hunger index</span>), and significant global economic recession (<span class="trend-down">-5% global GDP growth</span>).</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Failure of diplomatic efforts; escalation of major conflicts; misuse of advanced technologies; collapse of global cooperation; severe climate change impacts.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Major armed conflicts; severe disruptions to global supply chains; widespread famine; hyperinflation; collapse of financial markets; mass migration.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Major powers fail to cooperate; diplomatic efforts fail; technological advancements are misused; climate change impacts cause widespread devastation; global governance systems collapse.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Widespread economic collapse; severe humanitarian crises; potential for global conflict; significant loss of life; long-term global instability.</p>
