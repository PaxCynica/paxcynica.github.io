    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong>  Legal challenges against fossil fuel companies and debates over climate policies are shaping the response to climate change.  Outcomes will significantly influence future emissions reductions and the allocation of responsibility for climate damages.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.exxonknews.org/p/hawaii-will-not-be-deterred-from">Hawai\u2019i Isn\u2019t Backing Down From Its Lawsuit Against Big Oil Over Climate Crisis</a></li>
