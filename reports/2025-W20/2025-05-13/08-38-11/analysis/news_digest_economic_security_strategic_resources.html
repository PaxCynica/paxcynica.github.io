  <h1>Economic Security & Strategic Resources Briefing</h1>

    <h3>1. US-China Trade War De-escalation</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> US, China, tariffs, trade war, trade talks, Geneva, Scott Bessent, substantial progress, 90-day pause</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The temporary reduction in tariffs signifies a potential easing of trade tensions between the US and China.
