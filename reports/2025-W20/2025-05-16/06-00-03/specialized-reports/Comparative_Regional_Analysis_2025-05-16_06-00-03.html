          <h3>Gaza Conflict</h3>
          <p>The Gaza conflict elicited strong and varied reactions.  Israel's actions drew international condemnation, particularly from France, while the US response under President Trump was muted, prioritizing business deals in other parts of the Middle East.

          <h3>US-China Tech Rivalry</h3>
          <p>The US-China tech rivalry continues to escalate, with the US imposing restrictions on Huawei technology globally.  China is likely to respond with countermeasures, potentially impacting global technology supply chains.  The Middle East's increased demand for AI chips, highlighted by deals with Nvidia and AMD, complicates the situation, showcasing how economic opportunities can intertwine with geopolitical tensions.  This competition is driving investments in domestic technology sectors worldwide.</p>

This approach, while boosting certain sectors like Boeing, has drawn criticism for neglecting the Gaza conflict and raising ethical questions regarding the nature of these agreements.
