        <div class="scenario scenario-high">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Escalation and Fragmentation <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (60%)</span></div>
          <p>This scenario projects a significant increase in geopolitical tensions, leading to regional conflicts and a fragmentation of global cooperation.  Drivers include escalating proxy wars, cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure, and a failure to address climate change effectively. Quantifiable indicators include a sharp increase in military spending globally ( <span class="trend-up">15-20%</span> increase in 2026-2027), a decline in global trade ( <span class="trend-down">5-10%</span> decrease in GDP growth), and increased volatility in energy and commodity markets. Signals include heightened rhetoric between major powers, increased cyberattacks on financial institutions, and widespread social unrest driven by economic hardship and resource scarcity. Key assumptions include continued polarization and a lack of effective multilateral diplomacy.</p>
          <div class="resource-allocation">
            <p>Resource allocation shifts towards military spending and defensive technologies, diverting funds from social programs and sustainable development initiatives.  This scenario presents significant risks to global economic growth and stability.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: Managed Competition and Gradual Change <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium (30%)</span></div>
          <p>This scenario anticipates a period of managed competition between major powers, characterized by strategic partnerships and cautious engagement.  Technological advancements, particularly in AI and renewable energy, drive economic growth and reshape global supply chains. Quantifiable indicators include moderate economic growth ( <span class="trend-neutral">2-3%</span> annual GDP growth), increased investment in renewable energy infrastructure (<span class="trend-up">10-15%</span> increase by 2028), and a slow but steady rise in global cooperation on climate change.  Signals include increased diplomatic engagement between rival nations, strategic partnerships in technology development, and a gradual shift towards sustainable economic practices. Key assumptions include a willingness to compromise and a focus on long-term economic stability.</p>
          <div class="resource-allocation">
            <p>Resource allocation is more balanced, with investment in both defense and sustainable development.  This scenario offers a more optimistic outlook for global stability and economic prosperity.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3: Collapse and Chaos <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low (10%)</span></div>
          <p>This scenario presents a worst-case outcome, characterized by widespread economic collapse, societal breakdown, and large-scale conflict.  Drivers include cascading failures in global supply chains, widespread cyberattacks, and the uncontrolled effects of climate change. Quantifiable indicators include a sharp global recession ( <span class="trend-down">>10%</span> GDP contraction), mass migrations driven by climate-related disasters, and a significant increase in global conflict. Signals include widespread social unrest, food shortages, and the collapse of major financial institutions. Key assumptions include a failure of governance structures and a lack of international cooperation.</p>
          <div class="resource-allocation">
            <p>Resource allocation becomes highly unpredictable, driven by survival needs and localized conflicts.  This scenario presents existential risks to global stability and human well-being.</p>
