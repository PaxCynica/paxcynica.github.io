        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>United States</h3>
          <p>The US strategy centers on maintaining its technological edge through a combination of sanctions, export controls (particularly on AI chips), and strategic partnerships with allied nations.  The ongoing restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductors to China, coupled with efforts to curb the smuggling of these components, highlight this approach.  Simultaneously, significant arms deals with Saudi Arabia demonstrate a focus on maintaining military superiority and regional influence.  The economic implications are significant, impacting both US companies (e.g., Boeing) and global supply chains.</p>
