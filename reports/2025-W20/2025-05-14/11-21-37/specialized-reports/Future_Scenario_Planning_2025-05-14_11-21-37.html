    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This report outlines three plausible future scenarios for the global economy and geopolitical landscape by 2026, focusing on the interplay between US-China relations, AI adoption, and global resource allocation.  The scenarios range from a relatively stable, albeit uneven, growth trajectory to significant geopolitical instability and economic disruption.  Uncertainty remains high, particularly regarding the unpredictable actions of key political actors.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Measured Growth & Cooperation<span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium</span></div>
          <p>This scenario assumes a cautious de-escalation of US-China tensions, leading to a period of measured economic growth.  AI adoption continues at a rapid pace, but with increased regulatory scrutiny.  Global resource allocation remains a challenge, but international cooperation efforts yield modest improvements in addressing climate change and food security in regions like Gaza.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: Uneven Growth & Geopolitical Instability<span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High</span></div>
          <p>This scenario projects uneven global growth, characterized by significant regional disparities.  US-China relations remain volatile, with unpredictable trade policies and technological competition.  AI adoption accelerates, but with increased concerns about job displacement and social disruption.  Climate change impacts intensify, leading to increased resource scarcity and humanitarian crises.</p>
