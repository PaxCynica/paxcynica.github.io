        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>United States</h3>
          <p>The US, under President Trump, is characterized by a focus on short-term economic gains and strategic alliances.  This approach is evident in the significant arms deals with Saudi Arabia and the temporary tariff reductions with China.  However, this strategy also involves ethical and geopolitical risks, as seen in the controversy surrounding the Qatar jet gift and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  The US is also grappling with the rapid advancement of AI, leading to workforce displacement and the need for regulatory frameworks.</p>

          <h3>China</h3>
          <p>China's response is centered on technological self-reliance and strategic investments, particularly in AI and semiconductors.  This is evident in the establishment of state-backed AI companies and increased investment in the semiconductor industry.  China is also carefully managing its relationship with the US, seeking to balance cooperation with competition in the global arena.  The trade truce with the US provides temporary relief but doesn't resolve underlying tensions.</p>
