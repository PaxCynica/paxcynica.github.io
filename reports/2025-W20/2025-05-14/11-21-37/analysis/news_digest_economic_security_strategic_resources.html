  <h2>Analyst’s Guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Closely monitor the ongoing US-China trade negotiations.  The 90-day truce is temporary, and further developments could significantly impact global markets.

    <li>Assess the impact of tariffs on various sectors, particularly small businesses and vulnerable populations.  Legal challenges to tariff policies should also be tracked.

    <li>Track the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the impact of the blockade on food security.  Consider the ethical and political implications of sanctions and economic coercion. (See: <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2025/5/13/gaza_famine_israeli_blockade">"People Are Starving to Death": Oxfam Warns Israel's Blockade on Gaza Is Catastrophic</a>)</li>
