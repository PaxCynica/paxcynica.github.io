  <h1>Climate Change & Environmental Security Briefing</h1>
  <span class="date">Prepared on 2025-05-14</span>
  <h2>Key Themes & Analysis</h2>
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Increased Frequency and Severity of Extreme Weather Events</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Wildfires, Flooding, Hurricanes, Heat Waves, Drought, Climate Refugees, Extreme Weather, Billion-Dollar Disasters</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong>  Record displacement of populations due to extreme weather events highlights the escalating human cost of climate change.  Increased disaster frequency strains resources and infrastructure, necessitating greater investment in climate adaptation and resilience measures.  This trend underscores the urgency for global climate action.</div>

  <div class="theme">
    <h3>2. Water Scarcity and its Geopolitical Implications</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Drought, Water Scarcity, Rio Grande, Water Treaties, Mexico, Texas Farmers, Water Management</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong>  Competition for dwindling water resources exacerbates existing tensions, particularly in transboundary regions like the US-Mexico border.  Water scarcity threatens agricultural productivity and food security, potentially leading to migration and conflict.  Effective international cooperation and sustainable water management are crucial to mitigating these risks.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
