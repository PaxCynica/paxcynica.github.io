          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Nvidia-led AI Hegemony <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">High Probability</span></div>
          <p>Nvidia maintains its dominant position in AI hardware, fueling rapid AI advancements primarily benefiting the US and its allies. This leads to significant economic growth in the tech sector and related industries, but also exacerbates the US-China tech rivalry and potential for conflict. Quantifiable indicators include Nvidia's market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion, continued dominance in GPU market share (over 80%), and significant increases in US AI-related patents.  Drivers include continued innovation in GPU technology, strong government support for AI development in the US, and limitations on Chinese access to advanced computing resources. Signals include increasing investments in US-based AI companies, growing technological gaps between US and China, and heightened geopolitical tensions.</p>
          <p>Key Assumptions: Continued technological innovation by Nvidia, sustained government support for AI in the US, limited success of Chinese efforts to develop competitive AI hardware.</p>
          <p>Potential Consequences: Increased economic inequality, global power shift towards the US, heightened risk of conflict.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: Balanced AI Development <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Medium Probability</span></div>
          <p>Increased competition from AMD, Intel, and Chinese tech companies leads to a more balanced global AI landscape.  This results in slower but more sustainable AI development, fostering greater international collaboration but also potentially slowing economic growth in the US tech sector.  Quantifiable indicators include a more even distribution of AI patent filings across multiple countries, increased market share for AMD and Intel, and a more moderate increase in Nvidia's market capitalization. Drivers include successful development of competitive AI hardware by other companies, increased international cooperation on AI standards, and effective AI regulations. Signals include increased investment in AI research in multiple countries, growing collaboration between tech companies across borders, and reduced geopolitical tensions related to AI.</p>
          <p>Key Assumptions: Successful development of competitive AI hardware by other companies, increased international cooperation on AI, effective AI regulations.</p>
          <p>Potential Consequences: More equitable distribution of AI benefits, reduced geopolitical tensions, slower but more sustainable economic growth.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3: AI-Driven Geopolitical Instability <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Low Probability</span></div>
          <p>Uncontrolled AI development leads to significant geopolitical instability.  This scenario involves escalating US-China tensions, potential for AI-driven cyberattacks and warfare, and significant economic disruption. Quantifiable indicators include a sharp decline in global stock markets, increased military spending, and a rise in cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure. Drivers include a lack of effective AI regulation, uncontrolled AI arms race, and increased mistrust between major powers. Signals include increased military investment in AI, rising cyberattacks, and escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>
          <p>Key Assumptions: Lack of effective AI regulation, uncontrolled AI arms race, significant increase in AI-enabled cyber warfare.</p>
          <p>Potential Consequences: Global economic recession, increased risk of armed conflict, potential for significant societal disruption.</p>
