    <h3>1.  Allegations of "White Genocide" in South Africa and Trump's Response</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> South Africa, Donald Trump, Cyril Ramaphosa, white genocide, false claims, video evidence, racial bias</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong>  Trump's unsubstantiated claims of "white genocide" in South Africa during a White House meeting with <strong>President Cyril Ramaphosa</strong> have fueled international controversy and raised concerns about the influence of racial bias in US foreign policy.
