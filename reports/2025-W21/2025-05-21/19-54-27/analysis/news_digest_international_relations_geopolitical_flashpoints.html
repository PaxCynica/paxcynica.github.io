  <h2>Analyst’s Guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Closely monitor developments in Gaza, paying particular attention to humanitarian aid delivery and international pressure on Israel. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cdr550j818po">UN warnings about infant mortality</a> are especially critical.</li>
    <li>Track the progress (or lack thereof) of peace talks in Ukraine and the potential for further sanctions or military involvement from European nations.  The ongoing phone calls between <strong>President Trump</strong> and <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> require careful analysis.</li>
    <li>Analyze the impact of US-China trade tensions on global supply chains and the potential for further economic shifts. The declining iPhone exports from China are a key indicator.</li>
    <li>Assess the implications of President Trump's foreign policy decisions on global stability and international relations.  His actions regarding Iran, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/20/eu-to-sustain-radio-free-europe-with-emergency-funding-after-trump-cuts">Radio Free Europe</a>, and other international organizations are crucial data points.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the evolving regional dynamics in South Asia, particularly the India-Pakistan conflict and the role of China.  Allegations of Chinese intelligence support for Pakistan are a matter of serious concern.</li>
