    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The successful, albeit near-miss, Houthi missile attack on Ben Gurion Airport on May 4th, 2025, necessitates a reassessment of Israeli and regional missile defense capabilities. This event underscores the evolving technological capabilities of non-state actors and highlights the limitations of current defense systems.  This analysis will explore policy implications and potential responses to this escalating threat.</p>

      <h2>Key Analysis</h2>
      <div class="historical-context">
        <p>Historically, asymmetric warfare has challenged established military powers.  The rise of precision-guided munitions and readily available drone technology has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for non-state actors seeking to inflict damage on high-value targets. The Houthi attack represents a significant escalation of this trend.</p>

  <div class="policy-implications">
    <h2>Policy Implications and Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Several policy options merit consideration in response to the escalating Houthi threat:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enhanced Missile Defense Systems:</strong> Increased investment in next-generation missile defense technologies, including AI-driven systems capable of intercepting a wider range of threats, is crucial.  Drawbacks include high costs and potential limitations in effectiveness against highly maneuverable or swarm attacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Strengthening Regional Alliances:</strong> Fortifying military and intelligence cooperation between Israel, the US, and other regional allies is necessary to improve threat detection and response capabilities.  Drawbacks include the risk of further escalation and potential for unintended consequences.</li>
      <li><strong>Targeting Houthi Supply Chains:</strong> Intensifying efforts to disrupt Houthi access to weapons and technology through targeted sanctions and covert operations could reduce their offensive capabilities. Drawbacks include the potential for civilian casualties and the risk of unintended escalation.</li>
      <li><strong>Diplomatic Engagement:</strong> Pursuing diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions and potentially negotiate a ceasefire remains a vital, albeit challenging, avenue. Drawbacks include the difficulty of reaching a lasting agreement with a determined adversary.</li>
      <li><strong>Addressing Root Causes:</strong> Long-term stability requires addressing the underlying political and socioeconomic factors fueling the conflict in Yemen, including poverty, inequality, and lack of governance. Drawbacks include the long timeframe and complexity of implementing such solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A multi-faceted approach, combining enhanced defense capabilities with diplomatic efforts and a focus on long-term stability in Yemen, is essential to mitigate the threat posed by the Houthis and prevent further escalation in the region.</p>

  <!-- Implications Section (optional) -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Implications & Significance</h2>
    <p>The Houthi attack represents a significant turning point in regional security. The implications extend beyond the immediate military response, impacting international relations, economic stability, and the global discourse on asymmetric warfare.  Failure to adequately address this threat could embolden other non-state actors and destabilize the region further.</p>
