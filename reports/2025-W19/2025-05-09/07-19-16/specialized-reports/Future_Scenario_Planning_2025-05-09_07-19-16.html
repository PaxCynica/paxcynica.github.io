          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Google's Continued Dominance<span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium</span></div>
          <p>Google retains its leading market share in search and AI services despite increased competition.  This scenario assumes Google successfully integrates advanced AI capabilities into its existing products and services, maintaining user loyalty and attracting new customers.  Quantifiable indicators include Google maintaining over 70% market share in search, continued strong revenue growth in its AI-related services, and a steady increase in user engagement metrics.  Drivers include substantial R&D investment, effective marketing strategies, and a successful adaptation to the evolving AI landscape. Signals include Google's continued dominance in search engine rankings, positive investor sentiment, and the lack of significant market share gains by competitors.</p>
          <p>Key Assumptions:  Successful adaptation to AI advancements, sustained user loyalty, effective competitive response, limited regulatory intervention.</p>
          <p>Potential Consequences:  Continued market consolidation, limited innovation outside of Google's ecosystem, potential for antitrust concerns.</p>
