        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>South Asia (India-Pakistan)</h3>
          <p>The India-Pakistan conflict, marked by drone warfare and retaliatory strikes, has led to a significant military response from both nations.  India has demonstrated effective counter-drone technology, while Pakistan continues to deploy drones.  This conflict highlights the escalating use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in modern warfare and the potential for rapid escalation given the nuclear capabilities of both nations. The economic impact includes disruptions to regional trade and increased defense spending.</p>

        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>Eastern Europe (Ukraine)</h3>
          <p>The war in Ukraine continues to dominate the geopolitical landscape.  While there have been calls for ceasefires and diplomatic solutions, the conflict persists with ongoing military actions.  The international community's response is fragmented, with some nations providing military aid to Ukraine while others maintain neutrality or support Russia.  Economic impacts include significant disruptions to global energy markets and supply chains, as well as substantial humanitarian costs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>East Asia (Korea)</h3>
          <p>North Korea's continued missile tests and simulated nuclear strikes have prompted increased military exercises by South Korea and the US.  International sanctions remain in place, but North Korea's defiance underscores the challenges of containing nuclear proliferation.  Regional instability impacts investment and trade within East Asia, leading to economic uncertainty.</p>
