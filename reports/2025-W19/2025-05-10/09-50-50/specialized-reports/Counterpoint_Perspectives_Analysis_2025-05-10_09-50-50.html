        <div class="perspective perspective-a">
          <h3>Pro-Tariff Perspective</h3>
          <p>Supporters of President Trump's tariffs argue that these measures are necessary to protect American industries from unfair competition and to bring back manufacturing jobs to the US.  They contend that the short-term economic pain is outweighed by the long-term benefits of a stronger domestic economy and increased national security.</p>
          <div class="cultural-context">
            <p>This perspective often resonates with communities directly affected by job losses in the manufacturing sector, tapping into feelings of economic insecurity and a desire for national resurgence.</p>

          <h3>Anti-Tariff Perspective</h3>
          <p>Critics argue that the tariffs have significantly disrupted global supply chains, leading to increased prices for consumers, inflation, and uncertainty in global markets. They contend that the negative impacts on international relations and the exacerbation of existing humanitarian crises in vulnerable regions outweigh any potential benefits.  Furthermore, they point to the potential for retaliatory tariffs to harm American businesses.</p>
