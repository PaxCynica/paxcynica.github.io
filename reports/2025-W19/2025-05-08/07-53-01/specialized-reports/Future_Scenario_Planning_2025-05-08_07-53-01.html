        <div class="scenario scenario-high">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Accelerated AI Integration <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (60%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> Widespread and rapid adoption of AI across all sectors, leading to significant productivity gains but also substantial job displacement.  Technological breakthroughs accelerate the pace of innovation, creating new industries and market opportunities.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> GDP growth <span class="trend-up">5-7%</span> annually, unemployment rate <span class="trend-up">10-15%</span>, AI-related investments <span class="trend-up">trillions</span> of dollars.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Continued advancements in generative AI, increased investment in AI research and development, lack of significant regulatory hurdles.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Rapid expansion of AI-powered automation across industries, significant increases in productivity, widespread job losses in certain sectors, emergence of new AI-driven industries.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Continued technological progress in AI, relatively smooth transition to an AI-driven economy, effective reskilling and upskilling programs.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Increased economic growth, significant social disruption due to job displacement, widening wealth inequality, potential for social unrest.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: Moderate AI Adoption <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium (30%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> Gradual and measured adoption of AI, with a focus on augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing them.  Regulatory frameworks are implemented to mitigate risks and ensure ethical development.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> GDP growth <span class="trend-up">2-4%</span> annually, unemployment rate <span class="trend-neutral">relatively stable</span>, AI-related investments <span class="trend-up">hundreds of billions</span> of dollars.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Cautious regulatory approach, focus on responsible AI development, concerns about job displacement and ethical implications.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Steady integration of AI in various sectors, moderate increases in productivity, limited job displacement, increased focus on human-AI collaboration.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Balanced approach to AI development and regulation, effective workforce adaptation strategies, focus on ethical considerations.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Sustainable economic growth, minimized social disruption, moderate increase in wealth inequality, reduced risks associated with uncontrolled AI development.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3: Stagnant AI Development <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low (10%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> Slow progress in AI development due to technological limitations, regulatory constraints, or lack of investment.  AI adoption remains limited, with minimal impact on the global economy.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> GDP growth <span class="trend-neutral">similar to pre-AI trends</span>, unemployment rate <span class="trend-neutral">relatively stable</span>, AI-related investments <span class="trend-down">significantly reduced</span>.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Technological bottlenecks, stringent regulatory frameworks, reduced investment in AI research and development.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Limited adoption of AI in various sectors, slow progress in AI capabilities, minimal impact on productivity and employment, focus on addressing existing technological challenges.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Technological limitations hinder AI progress, strict regulatory frameworks limit AI applications, reduced public and private investment.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Continued economic growth along existing trends, minimal social disruption, limited impact on wealth inequality, missed opportunities for economic and social progress.</p>
