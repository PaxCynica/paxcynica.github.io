          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1:  Responsible AI Dominance <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> OpenAI's public benefit corporation model proves successful, fostering responsible AI development and widespread adoption of ethical guidelines. This leads to sustained economic growth driven by AI innovation, but with a focus on equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks. </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong>  Increased investment in AI safety research (<span class="trend-up"> +20%</span> year-on-year),  widespread adoption of AI ethics standards by major tech companies (<span class="trend-up"> +80%</span>),  reduction in AI-related job displacement (<span class="trend-down"> -15%</span>),  stable economic growth driven by AI innovation (<span class="trend-up"> +3-4%</span> GDP growth).</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Strong regulatory frameworks,  public pressure for ethical AI,  successful implementation of AI safety measures.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  International cooperation on AI regulation,  continued technological advancement without unforeseen breakthroughs.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Sustainable economic growth,  reduced societal disruption from AI,  enhanced global cooperation.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2:  Uneven AI Growth <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> OpenAI's model faces challenges, leading to uneven growth in the AI sector.  Some companies prioritize profit over ethics, creating risks of AI misuse and exacerbating existing inequalities.  Economic growth remains strong but is accompanied by increased social unrest and regulatory struggles. </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong> Increased AI-related security breaches (<span class="trend-up"> +30%</span>),  uneven distribution of AI benefits (<span class="trend-up"> Gini coefficient +5 points</span>),  increased social unrest related to AI (<span class="trend-up"> +25%</span> protest events),  moderate economic growth (<span class="trend-up"> +1-2%</span> GDP growth).</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Lack of effective regulation,  prioritization of profit over ethics by some companies,  geopolitical tensions.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Limited international cooperation on AI regulation,  continued technological advancements.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Increased social inequality,  potential for AI misuse,  heightened geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3:  AI Development Stagnation <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong>  Concerns over AI safety and ethical implications lead to significant regulatory hurdles and decreased investment in the sector.  This results in slower economic growth and a loss of global leadership in AI. </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong>  Decreased investment in AI research (<span class="trend-down"> -10%</span> year-on-year),  significant regulatory delays in AI development (<span class="trend-up"> +50%</span> average approval time),  slower economic growth (<span class="trend-neutral"> 0-1%</span> GDP growth),  loss of global AI leadership to other nations.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Overly stringent regulations,  public fear of AI,  lack of trust in AI developers.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Significant regulatory setbacks,  reduced public and private investment in AI.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Slower economic growth,  loss of technological competitiveness,  potential for missed opportunities.</p>
