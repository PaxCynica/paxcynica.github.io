    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This report outlines three plausible scenarios for the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on global geopolitics between 2025 and 2030.  The scenarios consider the interplay of technological advancements, economic competition, and geopolitical tensions, focusing on AI's potential to exacerbate existing conflicts and create new ones.  Quantifiable indicators, drivers, and signals are provided for each scenario, along with an assessment of potential consequences.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: AI-Driven Escalation (High Probability)</div>
          <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (70%)</span>
          <p><b>Description:</b> AI accelerates existing geopolitical tensions, leading to increased military spending, cyber warfare, and potential conventional conflict.  Nation-states leverage AI for autonomous weapons systems, targeted disinformation campaigns, and sophisticated cyberattacks.  Economic competition intensifies as countries vie for AI dominance, leading to protectionist policies and trade disputes.</p>
          <p><b>Indicators:</b> Increased military budgets (↑20% globally by 2028), rise in cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure (↑50% by 2027), significant trade restrictions on AI-related technologies (↑30% by 2029), development and deployment of autonomous weapons systems (at least 5 countries by 2028).</p>
          <p><b>Drivers:</b> AI arms race, mistrust between major powers, economic competition.</p>
          <p><b>Assumptions:</b> Continued rapid AI advancements, lack of international cooperation on AI governance, persistent geopolitical tensions.</p>
          <p><b>Consequences:</b> Increased risk of large-scale conflict, global economic instability, erosion of international norms.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: AI-Enabled Cooperation (Medium Probability)</div>
          <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium (20%)</span>
          <p><b>Description:</b>  Major powers recognize the potential risks of AI-driven conflict and cooperate to establish international norms and regulations.  AI is used for collaborative purposes, such as climate change mitigation, disease prevention, and economic development.  However, economic competition and geopolitical rivalries persist, albeit at a lower intensity.</p>
          <p><b>Indicators:</b> Establishment of a global AI governance body (by 2027), significant investment in collaborative AI projects (↑40% by 2030), reduction in military spending (↓10% globally by 2030), increased international trade in AI-related goods and services (↑15% by 2029).</p>
          <p><b>Drivers:</b> Shared recognition of existential threats, increased international cooperation.</p>
          <p><b>Assumptions:</b> Willingness of major powers to compromise, successful implementation of international agreements.</p>
          <p><b>Consequences:</b> Reduced risk of conflict, improved global cooperation, sustainable development.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3: AI-Induced Instability (Low Probability)</div>
          <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low (10%)</span>
          <p><b>Description:</b>  Uncontrolled AI development leads to unforeseen consequences, such as widespread job displacement, social unrest, and potential societal collapse.  Geopolitical tensions are exacerbated by these disruptions, leading to a period of prolonged instability and uncertainty.</p>
          <p><b>Indicators:</b>  High unemployment rates (↑15% globally by 2028), widespread social unrest and protests (major incidents in at least 10 countries by 2029), significant decline in global GDP (↓5% by 2030), collapse of international institutions.</p>
          <p><b>Drivers:</b> Uncontrolled AI development, lack of social safety nets, economic inequality.</p>
          <p><b>Assumptions:</b> Failure to address the social and economic consequences of AI, lack of effective governance.</p>
          <p><b>Consequences:</b>  Prolonged global instability, societal disruption, potential for widespread conflict.</p>
