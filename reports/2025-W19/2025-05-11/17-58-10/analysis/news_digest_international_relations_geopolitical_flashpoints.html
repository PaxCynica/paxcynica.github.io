    <ul class="examples">

  <div class="theme">
    <h3>4. Iran Nuclear Talks</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Iran, US, nuclear talks, Oman, uranium enrichment, Trump</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The ongoing indirect talks between the US and Iran regarding Iran's nuclear program remain crucial for regional stability.

The upcoming <strong>President Trump's</strong> Middle East trip adds another layer of complexity to the negotiations.</div>
