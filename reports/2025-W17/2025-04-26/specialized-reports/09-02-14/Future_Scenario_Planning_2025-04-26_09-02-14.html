          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Escalation and Recession <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (60%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Continued escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war, further trade restrictions between the US and China, significant supply chain disruptions, and a global energy crisis. </p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong>  <span class="trend-down">Global GDP growth below 1%</span>, <span class="trend-up">Global inflation above 5%</span>, <span class="trend-down">Major stock market indices decline by 20% or more</span>, <span class="trend-up">Oil prices above $150/barrel</span>, increased frequency of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Prolonged stalemate in the Russia-Ukraine war, continued trade tensions without significant escalation, moderate supply chain disruptions, and gradual transition to renewable energy.</p>
