  <section class="summary-section">
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Global economic uncertainty in late April 2025 is significantly influenced by US-China trade tensions, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and general market volatility.  Three plausible scenarios are projected for the next six months, ranging from a relatively stable recovery to a prolonged period of recession and geopolitical instability.  These scenarios are based on current market indicators and geopolitical trends, but significant uncertainty remains.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Gradual Economic Recovery <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (60%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> US-China trade tensions ease, leading to increased global trade and investment.  The Russia-Ukraine conflict remains unresolved but doesn't significantly escalate.  Inflation gradually decreases, allowing central banks to maintain stable interest rates. Market volatility reduces, and global economic growth accelerates modestly.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Global GDP growth <span class="trend-up">2.5%</span>, Inflation <span class="trend-down">3%</span>, S&P 500 <span class="trend-up">4500</span>, Oil prices <span class="trend-neutral">$80/barrel</span>.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Successful trade negotiations, de-escalation of geopolitical tensions, effective monetary policy.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Increased cross-border investment, rising consumer confidence, stable currency markets.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Rational actors prioritize economic stability over political posturing; effective communication channels prevent miscalculations.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Increased global prosperity, reduced market volatility, strengthening of international cooperation.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: Stagnation and Continued Volatility <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium (30%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> US-China trade tensions persist, hindering global growth. The Russia-Ukraine war continues with limited escalation. Inflation remains elevated, forcing central banks to maintain high interest rates. Market volatility continues, with significant fluctuations in various sectors.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Global GDP growth <span class="trend-neutral">1%</span>, Inflation <span class="trend-neutral">4%</span>, S&P 500 <span class="trend-neutral">4000</span>, Oil prices <span class="trend-up">$90/barrel</span>.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Prolonged trade disputes, geopolitical instability, persistent inflation.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Slowing investment growth, decreased consumer confidence, fluctuating currency markets.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Political gridlock prevents decisive action; economic uncertainty persists.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Slower global growth, continued market uncertainty, potential for regional conflicts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3: Global Recession and Geopolitical Crisis <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low (10%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong>  US-China trade war escalates, triggering a global recession.  The Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifies, potentially involving other major powers.  Inflation remains high, leading to further interest rate hikes.  Market volatility is extreme, causing significant financial losses and widespread economic hardship.</p>

          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Major trade disruptions, large-scale geopolitical conflict, uncontrolled inflation.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Sharp decline in investment, plummeting consumer confidence, significant currency devaluations.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Major miscalculations lead to escalation of conflict; economic policies fail to mitigate the crisis.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Severe global recession, widespread social unrest, potential for major armed conflict.</p>

    <h2>Implications & Significance</h2>
    <p>The unfolding scenario will have profound implications for global resource allocation.  Scenario 1 would allow for continued investment in sustainable development and technological innovation. Scenario 2 would necessitate a shift towards prioritizing short-term stability and risk mitigation. Scenario 3 would require emergency resource allocation to address humanitarian needs and prevent widespread societal collapse.</p>
    <div class="resource-allocation">
      <p>Further analysis is needed to determine the precise allocation of resources under each scenario.  This will depend on the specific nature of the crisis and the priorities of various stakeholders.</p>
