  <h2>Key Themes & Analysis</h2>
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Apple's Supply Chain Shift from China to India</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Apple, iPhone, China, India, supply chain, tariffs, trade war, manufacturing</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> This shift reflects a significant geopolitical and economic realignment.  It indicates growing concerns about reliance on China for manufacturing, driven by President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s tariff policies and potential future trade disruptions. This could lead to increased manufacturing costs in India initially but potentially lower costs over time.  It also signifies a potential boost for India's economy and workforce.</div>
