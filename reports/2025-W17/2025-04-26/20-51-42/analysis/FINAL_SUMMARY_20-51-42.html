        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Global markets remain volatile amid persistent US-China trade tensions, despite some reports of minor tariff rollbacks. Conflicting statements from leaders underscore the unpredictable nature of negotiations, impacting business confidence and investment worldwide. This uncertainty is compounded by broader global economic concerns, with investors closely watching central bank policies like potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.</p>
        <p>Major conflicts continue to drive humanitarian crises and geopolitical instability. The war in Ukraine saw a significant attack on Kyiv, allegedly involving North Korean weaponry, highlighting potential external support for Russia and expanding the conflict's scope. Simultaneously, the Israeli blockade is severely impacting humanitarian aid delivery in Gaza, leading to depleted food stocks and urgent calls for international intervention.</p>
        <p>Escalating tensions between India and Pakistan following a shooting in Kashmir raise concerns about potential armed conflict in a nuclear-armed region. Separately, underlying tensions persist between Congo and Rwanda, although a US-brokered agreement offers a potential pathway to peace. These regional hotspots contribute to the overall fragile global security environment.</p>
        <p>Compounding these challenges, state-sponsored cyber threats, particularly from groups linked to North Korea, pose a significant risk to critical infrastructure and supply chains globally, as evidenced by recent attacks targeting South Korea.</p>
