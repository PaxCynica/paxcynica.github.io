    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Global economic uncertainty in late April 2025 is primarily driven by US-China trade tensions, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and persistent inflation.  Three plausible scenarios are projected for the next 12 months: a scenario of continued volatility, a scenario of cautious recovery, and a scenario of a deeper global recession.  These scenarios are assessed based on current market indicators and geopolitical developments.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Continued Volatility <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium</span></div>
          <p>This scenario assumes that US-China trade negotiations remain stalled, the war in Ukraine continues with no clear resolution, and inflation persists at elevated levels.  Market volatility will remain high, with significant fluctuations in stock prices and currency values.  Economic growth will be sluggish, and investment will remain cautious.</p>

          </table>
          <div class="data-visualization"></div>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Stalled trade talks, prolonged conflict in Ukraine, persistent inflation.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> High market volatility, low business confidence, continued geopolitical tensions.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Slow economic growth, increased social unrest, potential for further market corrections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario scenario-high">
          <div class="scenario-title">Cautious Recovery <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High</span></div>
          <p>This scenario assumes a partial resolution to US-China trade disputes, a de-escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, and a gradual decline in inflation.  Markets will stabilize, and investor confidence will improve, leading to modest economic growth. However, uncertainty will persist, and a full recovery will be slow.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <div class="data-visualization"></div>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Progress in trade negotiations, diplomatic efforts in Ukraine, effective monetary policy.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Increased investor confidence, rising stock markets, stabilizing currency values.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Moderate economic growth, reduced market volatility, improved social stability.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Deeper Global Recession <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low</span></div>
          <p>This scenario assumes a significant escalation of the war in Ukraine, a complete breakdown in US-China relations, and a failure to control inflation.  Global markets will experience a sharp downturn, leading to a severe global recession with high unemployment and social unrest. This scenario is considered less likely but carries significant risks.</p>

          <div class="data-visualization"></div>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Major escalation of the Ukraine war, complete trade war between US and China, uncontrolled inflation.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Sharp market declines, high unemployment, significant social unrest.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Severe economic hardship, widespread social unrest, potential for political instability.</p>

  <!-- Implications Section (optional) -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Implications & Significance</h2>
    <p>The unfolding economic scenario will significantly impact resource allocation globally. Governments will need to prioritize spending on social safety nets, infrastructure projects, and defense. Businesses will need to adapt to changing market conditions and manage risks associated with uncertainty.  International cooperation will be crucial for navigating these challenges.</p>
    <div class="resource-allocation">
      <p>Potential resource allocation shifts include increased spending on social welfare programs, infrastructure investments to bolster resilience, and potentially increased military spending in response to geopolitical instability.  Businesses may shift investment towards more stable sectors, potentially leading to job losses in more vulnerable industries.</p>
