    <h3>1. US Tariffs on Southeast Asian Solar Panels</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> US, tariffs, solar panels, Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, China, trade</div>
    <p>The US Department of Commerce announced tariffs ranging up to 3,521% on solar panels from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia.  This action is ostensibly aimed at countering alleged Chinese dumping and subsidies, significantly impacting the solar industry and potentially escalating trade tensions.  The high tariff percentages are unprecedented.</p>
