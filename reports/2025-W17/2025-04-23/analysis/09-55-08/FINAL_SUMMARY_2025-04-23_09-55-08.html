    <h2>Potential Scenarios</h2>
    <div class="scenarios">
        <p><strong>Scenario 1: Increased Global Fragmentation and Conflict</strong></p>
        <p>Trade wars intensify with retaliatory tariffs spreading beyond current disputes, severely disrupting global supply chains and triggering a significant economic slowdown. Peace talks in Ukraine and Gaza collapse, leading to prolonged and potentially escalating conflicts with increased humanitarian costs and regional spillover. Geopolitical competition, particularly between the US and China, heightens, manifesting in increased military posturing in flashpoints like the South China Sea and a race for dominance in critical technologies like AI and quantum computing, increasing the risk of miscalculation and limited conflicts.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Scenario 2: Cautious De-escalation and Adaptation</strong></p>
        <p>While trade tensions persist, major escalations are avoided through limited negotiations or tacit agreements, allowing global supply chains to partially adjust. Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza remain contained, potentially seeing localized ceasefires or limited progress in de-escalation efforts, although long-term peace remains elusive. AI development continues rapidly, but governments begin to implement fragmented regulatory frameworks aimed at balancing innovation with security and ethical concerns. Countries prioritize domestic resilience, investing in supply chain diversification, cybersecurity, and climate adaptation measures to mitigate external shocks.</p>
