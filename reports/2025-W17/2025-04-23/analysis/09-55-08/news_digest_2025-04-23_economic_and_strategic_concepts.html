    <h3>1.  Global Energy Security Concerns</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Energy security, resource nationalism, supply chain security, tariffs, critical mineral access, rare earth supply chains</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong>  The ongoing instability in global energy markets, highlighted by the IEA's warning and the US imposing tariffs on Southeast Asian solar panels, points to a heightened risk of supply chain disruptions and price volatility. This underscores the need for diversification of energy sources and strengthening of domestic energy production capabilities.  Resource nationalism poses a significant threat to global energy security, potentially leading to geopolitical tensions.</div>
