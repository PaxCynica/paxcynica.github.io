    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> State Department, <strong>Trump</strong>, <strong>Rubio</strong>, budget cuts, human rights, war crimes, office closures</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The significant restructuring of the US State Department under <strong>Secretary of State Marco Rubio</strong>, as directed by <strong>President Trump</strong>, raises concerns about the future of US foreign policy, particularly regarding human rights and international justice.
