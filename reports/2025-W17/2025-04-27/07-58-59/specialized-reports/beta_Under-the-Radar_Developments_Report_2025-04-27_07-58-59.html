      <h3>AI-Driven Influence Operations:</h3>
      <p>Intelligence suggests the emergence of sophisticated, AI-powered influence operations capable of targeting voters with hyper-personalized disinformation campaigns.  These operations leverage vulnerabilities in voting systems and private infrastructure, combining technical expertise with behavioral manipulation.  This represents a high-severity threat to democratic processes.</p>
      <div class="vulnerability-analysis">
        <div class="vulnerability-item severity-high">
          <span class="vulnerability-title">AI-Enabled Disinformation</span>
          <span class="severity-label high">High Severity</span>
          <p>Sophisticated AI-driven campaigns pose a significant threat to democratic processes and elections.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Critical Mineral Competition:</h3>
      <p>Geopolitical tensions are intensifying competition for critical minerals essential for advanced technologies.  The US's pressure on Ukraine to secure mineral deals highlights the strategic importance of these resources.  This creates vulnerabilities in supply chains and increases the risk of conflict.</p>
      <div class="vulnerability-analysis">
        <div class="vulnerability-item severity-medium">
          <span class="vulnerability-title">Critical Mineral Shortages</span>
