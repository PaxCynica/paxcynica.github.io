      <h2>Key Analysis: Economic Impacts of Tariffs</h2>
      <p>Multiple reports indicate that President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are significantly impacting the global economy.  Inflation is rising, consumer sentiment is down, and fears of a recession are increasing.  The impact on small businesses is particularly severe, with many facing increased import costs and potential bankruptcy.  Large corporations, such as Apple, are responding by shifting production to other countries, notably India, creating ripple effects across global supply chains.</p>

      <h2>Potential Policy Responses</h2>
      <div class="scenario-container">
        <div class="scenario scenario-high">
          <div class="scenario-title">Tariff Reduction/Negotiated Settlement <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">High Probability</span></div>
          <p>This scenario involves bilateral negotiations between the US and China to reduce or eliminate tariffs.  This could stabilize markets, reduce inflation, and ease supply chain disruptions. However, it requires significant political will from both sides and may involve compromises on other trade issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Diversification of Supply Chains <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Medium Probability</span></div>
          <p>Governments and businesses could focus on diversifying their supply chains, reducing reliance on any single country.  This would mitigate risks associated with future trade disputes, but requires significant investment and may increase production costs in the short term.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Continued Escalation <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Low Probability (but high risk)</span></div>
          <p>This involves a continuation of the trade war with further tariff increases and retaliatory measures.  This scenario would likely lead to a global recession, significant job losses, and increased geopolitical instability.  It carries the highest risk but is less likely given the potential economic consequences.</p>
