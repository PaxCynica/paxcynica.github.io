    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Iran, US, nuclear deal, Oman, negotiations, sanctions,  Tehran,  Steve Witkoff, Abbas Araqchi</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong>  The ongoing US-Iran nuclear talks, held in Oman, could significantly impact regional stability.

    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Gaza Strip, Israel, food shortages, humanitarian aid, blockade, World Food Programme (WFP),  Cindy McCain</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The ongoing blockade of Gaza and reported food shortages create a severe humanitarian crisis.
