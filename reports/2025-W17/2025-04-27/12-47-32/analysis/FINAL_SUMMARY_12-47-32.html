    <h2>Potential Scenarios</h2>
    <div class="scenarios">
        <p><strong>Scenario 1: Protracted Geopolitical Friction with Localized Progress.</strong> US-China trade tensions persist with occasional escalations but avoid a full-blown trade war. US-Iran talks yield limited progress, preventing immediate conflict but failing to achieve a comprehensive nuclear deal. The Gaza crisis remains dire, with temporary truces punctuated by renewed violence. The Russia-Ukraine war continues as a grinding conflict with sporadic, low-level peace discussions yielding no major breakthroughs. AI development proceeds rapidly, with nationalistic competition hindering international cooperation on safety and ethics. Localized conflicts (India-Pakistan, Sudan) continue with humanitarian consequences.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 2: Increased Global Instability.</strong> US-Iran nuclear talks collapse, leading to increased regional tensions and potential military actions. Failed truce negotiations in Gaza result in a significant escalation of violence and a worsening humanitarian catastrophe, potentially spilling over into wider regional conflict. A new round of significant US tariffs triggers retaliatory measures, severely disrupting global trade and potentially leading to a recession. The Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifies with new offensives or expanded foreign intervention. Political polarization within major powers hinders effective international responses to crises.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 3: Economic Realignments and Technological Acceleration.</strong> Global supply chains continue to shift away from China, boosting economies in alternative manufacturing hubs like India and parts of Southeast Asia/Latin America. The AI race accelerates dramatically, driven by massive investments and rapid technological breakthroughs, leading to significant economic growth in the tech sector but also exacerbating concerns about job displacement and ethical control. While geopolitical tensions remain, the focus shifts slightly towards economic competition and technological dominance, with diplomatic efforts focused on securing access to critical resources and technological know-how rather than resolving entrenched conflicts.</p>
