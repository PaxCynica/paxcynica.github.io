  <h2>Analyst’s Guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Closely monitor statements and actions from both the <strong>US</strong> and <strong>China</strong> regarding trade negotiations.  Discrepancies, like those highlighted in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-china-clash-status-trade-talks/story?id=121118799">this ABC News article</a>, signal high risk.</li>
    <li>Assess the impact of supply chain disruptions on various sectors. Pay particular attention to the technology sector, as seen in articles concerning <strong>Apple</strong>'s supply chain challenges.</li>
    <li>Track legal challenges to <strong>Trump</strong>'s tariff policies. Court decisions could significantly alter the trade landscape.</li>
    <li>Analyze the responses of international partners to US trade actions.  Retaliatory measures could escalate tensions and further disrupt global trade.</li>
    <li>Consider the long-term implications of economic nationalism and protectionism for global economic growth and stability.  The analysis by <strong>Stephen S. Roach</strong> in <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-tariffs-attacks-on-fed-could-lead-to-stagflation-global-recession-by-stephen-s-roach-2025-04">this Project Syndicate article</a> provides valuable insight.</li>
