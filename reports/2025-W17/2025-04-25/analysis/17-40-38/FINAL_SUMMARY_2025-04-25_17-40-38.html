    <h2>Potential Scenarios</h2>
    <div class="scenarios">
        <p><strong>Scenario 1: Fragmented Global Order with Heightened Tensions.</strong> Continued escalation in Ukraine, the Middle East, and South Asia leads to further regional instability and proxy conflicts. The US-China trade war intensifies, causing significant disruptions to global supply chains and slower economic growth. Lack of international consensus hinders effective responses to global challenges like cybersecurity and AI regulation, leading to a more fragmented and volatile international system.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 2: Cautious De-escalation and Strategic Realignment.</strong> International diplomatic efforts, possibly involving new mediators or formats, lead to limited ceasefires or de-escalation in current conflicts, although underlying issues remain unresolved. Major powers find limited areas for cooperation on issues like AI safety or cybersecurity standards due to shared risks. Trade tensions persist but are managed through targeted negotiations rather than broad tariff escalation, leading to partial supply chain adjustments but avoiding a full global recession.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario 3: Tech-Driven Shift with Unforeseen Consequences.</strong> Rapid, unregulated advancements in AI and quantum computing create significant economic opportunities but also exacerbate job displacement and raise new national security risks. Cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, overwhelming current defenses. Geopolitical competition increasingly focuses on technological dominance, potentially leading to an arms race in AI-powered weapons or cyber capabilities, altering the global balance of power in unpredictable ways.</p>
