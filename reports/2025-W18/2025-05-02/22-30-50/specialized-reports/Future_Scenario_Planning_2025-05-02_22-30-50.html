          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Accelerated AI-Driven Growth (<span class="scenario-probability probability-high">High Probability</span>)</div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong>  Widespread, responsible AI adoption fuels significant economic growth, driven by increased productivity and innovation. International cooperation on AI safety and ethical guidelines is successful.  Geopolitical tensions remain, but do not significantly disrupt global trade.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Global GDP growth above 4%; significant increases in AI-related investments; strong consumer confidence; stable oil prices; reduced unemployment in tech-related sectors; successful implementation of international AI safety regulations.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Successful AI safety measures; increased international collaboration; continued investment in AI R&D; robust global supply chains.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Strong global stock markets; increased productivity across multiple sectors; rising demand for AI-related skills; stable global trade flows; successful international AI governance frameworks.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Effective regulation of AI; responsible AI development; continued global economic stability; limited escalation of geopolitical tensions.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Significant economic growth; increased global competitiveness; potential for widening income inequality; need for workforce reskilling.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: Stagnant Growth and Geopolitical Uncertainty (<span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Medium Probability</span>)</div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong>  AI adoption is uneven, leading to moderate economic growth. Geopolitical tensions and trade disputes disrupt global supply chains, limiting the benefits of AI. International cooperation on AI safety is partial and fragmented.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Global GDP growth between 2-3%; moderate AI investment; fluctuating oil prices; increased unemployment in some sectors; limited progress on international AI safety regulations; increased trade protectionism.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Partial AI regulation; limited international cooperation; supply chain disruptions; escalating geopolitical tensions; increased trade protectionism.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Volatile stock markets; slow economic growth; increased regional trade conflicts; rising inflation; increased cybersecurity threats; uneven AI adoption across countries.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Partial success in AI safety measures; limited international collaboration; continued geopolitical instability; significant supply chain disruptions.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Slower economic growth; increased global inequality; potential for regional conflicts; heightened cybersecurity risks.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3: Global Economic Recession and AI-Driven Instability (<span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Low Probability</span>)</div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong>  Uncontrolled AI development leads to significant economic disruption and geopolitical instability.  Malicious use of AI exacerbates conflicts, and global supply chains collapse. International cooperation fails.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Global GDP contraction; significant decrease in AI investment; sharp decline in consumer confidence; volatile oil prices; high unemployment; widespread social unrest; major supply chain disruptions; significant cybersecurity breaches.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Lack of AI regulation; absence of international cooperation; widespread malicious use of AI; major geopolitical conflicts; collapse of global supply chains.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Sharp decline in stock markets; widespread economic contraction; major regional conflicts; high inflation; significant cybersecurity breaches; increased social unrest; mass migration.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Failure of AI safety measures; lack of international collaboration; widespread geopolitical instability; complete collapse of global supply chains.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Global economic recession; increased global conflict; widespread social unrest; mass migration; significant loss of life.</p>
