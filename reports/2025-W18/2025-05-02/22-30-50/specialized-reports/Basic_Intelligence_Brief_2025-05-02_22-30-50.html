      <div class="theme-card">
        <h3>Geopolitical Instability</h3>
        <p>Tensions remain high between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, fueled by recent attacks.  The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war continues to cause significant human suffering and global economic uncertainty.

        <h3>AI Development and Security</h3>
        <p>Competition in the AI industry is fierce, with major tech companies vying for market dominance.  Concerns exist regarding potential monopolies and the ethical implications of widespread AI adoption.  Simultaneously, AI is creating new cybersecurity challenges, requiring innovative countermeasures.</p>

        <h3>Economic Uncertainty and Trade</h3>
        <p>Trump's tariff policies continue to disrupt global trade, causing economic uncertainty and impacting various sectors.  Companies are diversifying supply chains to reduce reliance on China.  A potential global recession remains a significant concern.</p>

        <h3>Climate Change Impacts</h3>
        <p>Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity, causing significant economic losses and humanitarian crises.

        <h3>Political Polarization and Protests</h3>
        <p>Widespread protests against the Trump administration highlight significant public dissatisfaction.  Allegations of election interference and crackdowns on dissent raise concerns about democratic backsliding.  The targeting of specific groups further fuels political polarization.</p>

        <h3>Military Technology and Warfare</h3>
        <p>Drone warfare is on the rise, raising ethical concerns about civilian casualties.

          <h3>Humanitarian Crises</h3>
          <p>Severe humanitarian crises are unfolding in Sudan and Gaza, exacerbated by conflict and blockades.
