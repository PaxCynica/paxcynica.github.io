    <h3>1. Trump's First 100 Days and Staff Shakeups</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Donald Trump, Mike Waltz, National Security Advisor, Signalgate, Cabinet Meeting,  Staff Shakeup, UN Ambassador, Tariffs,  Medicaid</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The early shakeups in Trump's second term signal potential instability and uncertainty in US foreign and domestic policy.

The replacement of <strong>Mike Waltz</strong> as National Security Advisor with <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, following the "Signalgate" incident, reflects Trump's prioritization of loyalty and potential disregard for established protocols.</div>
