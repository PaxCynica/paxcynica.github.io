  <h2>Key Themes & Analysis</h2>
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Impact of Trump's Tariffs on the US and Global Economy</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Trump tariffs, trade war, economic coercion, sanctions policy, oil prices, supply chain security, recession, global trade</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s tariff policies are causing significant disruptions to global trade, leading to higher prices for consumers, potential shortages of goods, and increased uncertainty about economic growth.  Several companies, including <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>General Motors</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong>, have reported negative impacts on their earnings due to the tariffs. The overall impact on the global economy is a potential recession.</div>

    <h3>2. Shifting Global Supply Chains and Resource Nationalism</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> supply chain security, resource nationalism, critical mineral access, rare earth supply chains, strategic manufacturing, tech sovereignty, semiconductor industry</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong>  The trade war is forcing companies to diversify their supply chains and reduce their reliance on <strong>China</strong> for critical technologies and resources. This is leading to increased investment in domestic manufacturing and strategic partnerships in other countries.  This trend could lead to a more fragmented global economy and increased geopolitical tensions.</div>
