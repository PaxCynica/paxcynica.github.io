    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This report outlines three plausible scenarios for the global economy and geopolitical landscape in 2026, focusing on the interplay between escalating US-China tensions, the impact of AI, and the ongoing war in Ukraine.  The scenarios range from a relatively stable, albeit challenging, global environment to a significantly more volatile and unstable one, with significant implications for resource allocation and economic growth.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Managed Instability <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium (40%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong>  US-China tensions remain high but are managed through a series of negotiated agreements and controlled escalations.  AI development continues at a rapid pace, leading to significant economic growth but also increased job displacement and ethical concerns. The war in Ukraine continues with no clear resolution, creating persistent geopolitical uncertainty but avoiding major escalation.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Global GDP growth of 2-3%;  Unemployment rates increase by 1-2% in developed nations;  Continued volatility in oil and commodity markets;  Increased investment in AI and cybersecurity.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Pragmatic diplomacy between the US and China;  International pressure to resolve the Ukraine conflict;  Continued innovation in AI technology.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Series of bilateral agreements between the US and China;  Increased diplomatic efforts to mediate the Ukraine conflict;  Sustained high levels of AI investment.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Rational actors prevail in geopolitical decision-making;  International institutions remain functional;  AI development remains largely beneficial.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Slow but steady economic growth;  Increased social inequality;  Persistent geopolitical tensions;  Need for significant investment in retraining and social safety nets.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2:  Severe Global Disruption <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (50%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> The US-China trade war escalates significantly, leading to widespread supply chain disruptions and a global recession.  AI development is hampered by export controls and geopolitical instability.  The war in Ukraine escalates, potentially involving other major powers.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Global GDP contraction of 1-2%;  Unemployment rates rise by 3-5%;  Sharp declines in global trade;  Significant increase in military spending.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Uncontrolled escalation of US-China tensions;  Failure of diplomatic efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict;  Widespread adoption of AI for military purposes.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Major trade sanctions imposed by the US and China;  Significant military build-up by major powers;  Sharp decline in global stock markets.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Geopolitical tensions escalate rapidly;  International institutions fail to effectively manage crises;  AI development is weaponized.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Severe global recession;  Widespread social unrest;  Increased risk of major military conflict;  Significant humanitarian crises.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3:  Limited Recovery <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low (10%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong>  US-China tensions ease somewhat, but the economic damage from the trade war is significant and long-lasting. AI development continues, but its benefits are unevenly distributed. The war in Ukraine ends, but the economic and social costs are substantial. </p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Slow global GDP growth (less than 1%);  High unemployment rates persist;  Slow recovery in global trade;  Increased regional instability.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Partial resolution of US-China tensions;  Limited progress in addressing AI-related ethical concerns;  Uneven distribution of economic benefits from AI.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Gradual easing of trade tensions;  Continued efforts to regulate AI;  Slow but steady economic growth in some regions.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Geopolitical instability persists;  Inequality increases;  The long-term impacts of the war in Ukraine are significant.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Slow economic recovery;  Increased social and political polarization;  Persistent regional conflicts;  Long-term challenges related to economic inequality and climate change.</p>
