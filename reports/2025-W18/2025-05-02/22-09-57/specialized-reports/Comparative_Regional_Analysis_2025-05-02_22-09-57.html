          <h3>United States</h3>
          <p>The US, under President Trump, is employing a protectionist strategy characterized by tariffs and export controls on AI chips. This approach aims to safeguard domestic industries and maintain technological dominance. However, it has resulted in economic uncertainty, impacting various sectors and potentially contributing to a global recession.  Resource allocation is heavily focused on national security, with a record-high budget proposed. The approach is met with both domestic and international backlash. </p>
