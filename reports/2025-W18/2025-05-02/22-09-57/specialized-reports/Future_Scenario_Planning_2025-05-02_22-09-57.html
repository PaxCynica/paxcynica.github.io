    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This report outlines three plausible future scenarios for the global economy and geopolitical landscape by 2026, focusing on the impacts of ongoing trade wars, technological advancements, and political instability.  The scenarios range from a relatively stable, albeit slow-growth, global economy to a more fractured and volatile environment characterized by significant economic downturn and heightened geopolitical tensions.  Key indicators and drivers are identified for each scenario, along with potential consequences for resource allocation and international cooperation.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Managed Decline (Moderate Probability)</div>
          <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium</span>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> Global economic growth remains sluggish, but avoids a major recession. Trade tensions ease somewhat, but protectionist policies persist.  AI adoption continues, but job displacement is managed through reskilling initiatives. Geopolitical tensions remain high, but major conflicts are avoided.</p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong> GDP growth <span class="trend-neutral">2-3%</span> globally; inflation <span class="trend-down">5-7%</span>; unemployment <span class="trend-neutral">4-6%</span>;  increased investment in renewable energy; continued trade disputes but with some bilateral agreements.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Gradual de-escalation of trade wars; successful implementation of reskilling programs; increased international cooperation on climate change; cautious investment in AI.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Slow but steady economic growth; increased inequality; continued geopolitical uncertainty; slower technological advancement than in other scenarios.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: Global Recession and Fragmentation (High Probability)</div>
          <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High</span>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> A major global recession occurs, driven by prolonged trade wars, supply chain disruptions, and economic uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions escalate, leading to increased regional conflicts.  AI adoption accelerates, but exacerbates job displacement and social unrest.</p>
          <p><strong>Indicators:</strong> Global GDP contraction <span class="trend-down">-2% to -5%</span>; high inflation <span class="trend-up">10-15%</span>; high unemployment <span class="trend-up">8-12%</span>; increased social unrest; major regional conflicts; significant decline in international trade.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Unresolved trade disputes; failure of reskilling initiatives; escalation of geopolitical tensions; uncontrolled AI adoption.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Severe economic hardship; widespread social unrest; increased migration; potential for major conflicts; long-term damage to global cooperation.</p>

    <h2>Implications & Significance</h2>
    <p>The unfolding scenarios have significant implications for resource allocation, both domestically and internationally.  Scenario 2, the global recession, would necessitate a shift towards crisis management and social safety nets. Scenario 3, the technological boom, would require strategic investments in education, infrastructure, and sustainable technologies.  The likelihood of each scenario unfolding depends on a complex interplay of political, economic, and technological factors, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies.</p>
