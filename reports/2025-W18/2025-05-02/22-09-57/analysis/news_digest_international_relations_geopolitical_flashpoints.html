    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Trump, tariffs, China, US, trade war, economic impact, Apple, iPhone</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The ongoing trade war between the US and China under President <strong>Trump's</strong> administration continues to significantly impact global markets.  <strong>Trump's</strong> tariffs are causing increased costs for companies like <strong>Apple</strong> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659866/apple-trump-tariffs-cost-tim-cook">The Verge</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/01/tim-cook-explains-why-apple-isnt-worried-about-iphone-tariffs/">9to5Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/tim-cook-tariffs-apple/">MacRumors</a>), potentially leading to higher prices for consumers and impacting global supply chains.  The situation remains tense with ongoing negotiations and threats of further escalation.</div>

    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Ukraine, US, minerals, deal, <strong>Trump</strong>, <strong>Zelenskyy</strong>, <strong>Medvedev</strong>, resource access, security guarantees</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The recently signed US-Ukraine minerals deal grants the US access to Ukraine's mineral resources.
