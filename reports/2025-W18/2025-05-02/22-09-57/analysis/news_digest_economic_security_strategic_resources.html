  <span class="date">Prepared on May 2, 2025</span>
  <h2>Key Themes & Analysis</h2>
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Widespread Impact of Trump's Trade War</h3>

The uncertainty is contributing to a potential global recession.</div>

    <h3>2. Shifting Global Supply Chains</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> supply chain security, strategic manufacturing, rare earth supply chains, critical mineral access, resource nationalism, tech sovereignty</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Companies are actively seeking to diversify their supply chains to mitigate risks associated with the trade war and geopolitical instability.  This involves shifting production away from China to other countries like India and Vietnam (<strong>Apple</strong>'s shift noted in multiple articles).  There's a growing focus on securing access to critical minerals and technologies, leading to increased resource nationalism and investments in domestic manufacturing.</div>

    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The trade war's impact varies across sectors.
