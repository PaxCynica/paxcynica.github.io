    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Ukraine, US, minerals deal,  <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>,  <strong>Donald Trump</strong>,  Russia,  security guarantees,  post-war reconstruction</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The recently signed Ukraine-US minerals deal is a significant development with far-reaching consequences.
