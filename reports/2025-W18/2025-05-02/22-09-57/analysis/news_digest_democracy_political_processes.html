  <h2>Analyst’s Guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Closely monitor protest activity and government responses globally.  Pay particular attention to regions with pre-existing tensions (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/1/tunisia-leader-saieds-opponents-supporters-stage-rival-rallies">Tunisia</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jdk9jlgpo">Turkey</a>, <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/syrias-druze-take-arms-defend-their-town-against-islamists-3772119">Syria</a>).</li>
    <li>Track legal challenges to <strong>President Trump</strong>'s policies and their potential impact on democratic institutions.  The <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/fox-smartmatic-seek-summary-judgment-court-filings/">Fox News/Smartmatic lawsuit</a> is a key indicator.</li>
    <li>Assess the effectiveness of disinformation campaigns and their influence on elections.  Analyze the spread of misinformation related to the <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2025/intell-250430-pna02.htm">Philippine elections</a> and other key electoral events.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the long-term implications of attacks on democratic institutions for global stability. The <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/protecteu-security-strategy-a-step-further-towards-a-digital-dystopian-future/">'ProtectEU' strategy</a> warrants close scrutiny.</li>
    <li>Monitor the evolving situation in Gaza and its potential to escalate regional conflicts.  The response of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crldw5gklrro">Israeli reservists</a> is a significant factor.</li>
