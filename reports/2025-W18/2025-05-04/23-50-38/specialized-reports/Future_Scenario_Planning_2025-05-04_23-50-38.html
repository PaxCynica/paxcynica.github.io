          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Continued US Dominance <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (60%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> US-based companies maintain their leading position in the semiconductor market, driven by sustained innovation and government support.  Trade restrictions prove effective in limiting Chinese competition. </p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong>  AMD and NVIDIA market share increases by 15% and 10% respectively; Intel maintains its position; TSMC production capacity expands, but primarily for US clients;  Chinese semiconductor production growth slows significantly.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Continued investment in R&D, successful implementation of trade restrictions, strong government support for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Increased US government spending on semiconductor research and manufacturing; successful legal challenges against Chinese companies; continued dominance of US companies in high-end chip production.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  US government policies remain consistent; technological advancements favor US companies; international cooperation on trade restrictions.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Increased US economic strength; limited technological advancement in China; potential for increased global tensions.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2: Increased Global Competition <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium (30%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> Increased competition from other regions, particularly China, challenges US dominance. Trade restrictions have a limited impact, and technological advancements are more evenly distributed.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong>  Market share shifts among major players;  Chinese semiconductor production growth accelerates;  new entrants from other regions gain market share.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Technological breakthroughs in other regions;  ineffective trade restrictions;  increased investment in semiconductor manufacturing outside the US.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Significant increase in Chinese semiconductor exports; emergence of new major players in the semiconductor market; weakening of US dominance in certain chip segments.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Trade restrictions are partially effective; technological innovation is more evenly distributed; increased geopolitical cooperation on technology development.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Increased global competition;  more diverse semiconductor supply chains; potential for reduced US economic dominance.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3: Geopolitical Disruption <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low (10%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> Geopolitical tensions escalate, disrupting global semiconductor supply chains. Trade restrictions severely impact production, leading to shortages and price increases.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Significant decrease in global semiconductor production; sharp increase in chip prices; widespread shortages of critical components; decreased global GDP growth.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Escalation of geopolitical conflicts;  severe trade restrictions;  disruption of global supply chains.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Significant disruptions in semiconductor manufacturing;  widespread shortages of chips;  sharp increase in inflation;  global economic slowdown.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  Geopolitical tensions escalate significantly;  trade restrictions are highly effective in disrupting production;  limited international cooperation on resolving conflicts.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong>  Global economic recession;  technological stagnation;  increased geopolitical instability.</p>
