          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: US Semiconductor Hegemony <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium</span></div>
          <p>This scenario projects significant US dominance in the semiconductor market by 2030. Driven by substantial government investment and a focus on reshoring production, US manufacturers achieve a commanding lead in advanced chip fabrication.  This leads to a decline in market share for Asian competitors, potentially triggering geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.</p>

          </table>
          <div class="data-visualization"></div>
          <p><strong>Key Assumptions:</strong> Continued high levels of US government investment, successful implementation of the CHIPS Act, limited success of Asian competitors in developing advanced fabrication technologies, and increased geopolitical tensions.</p>
          <p><strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> Increased US technological dominance, potential for trade wars and sanctions, heightened geopolitical instability, and a shift in global economic power dynamics.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 2:  Balanced Global Competition <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High</span></div>
          <p>This scenario projects a more balanced global semiconductor market by 2030.  While US investment boosts domestic production, Asian manufacturers maintain significant market share through innovation and diversification of supply chains.  Geopolitical tensions remain, but are managed through international cooperation and trade agreements.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <div class="data-visualization"></div>
          <p><strong>Key Assumptions:</strong> Continued but moderated US government investment, successful innovation by Asian manufacturers, increased cooperation on supply chain security, and a reduction in geopolitical tensions.</p>
          <p><strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> A more stable global semiconductor market, reduced geopolitical risks, increased competition driving innovation, and a more balanced distribution of economic benefits.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3:  Global Supply Chain Crisis <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low</span></div>
          <p>This scenario projects a severe global supply chain crisis by 2030, characterized by significant shortages of semiconductors and escalating prices.  Geopolitical tensions and trade disputes disrupt production and distribution, leading to economic instability and potential recession.  The US benefits minimally from its investment due to widespread market disruptions.</p>
