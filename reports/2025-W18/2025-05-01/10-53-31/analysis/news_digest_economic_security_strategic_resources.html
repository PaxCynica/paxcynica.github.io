    <h3>1. Devastating Impact of Trump's Trade War</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> trade war, tariffs, economic coercion, sanctions policy, oil prices, GDP, supply chain security</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The trade war initiated by <strong>President Donald Trump</strong> is causing significant economic damage, impacting global growth, and raising concerns about potential recession.

This could lead to further geopolitical instability.</div>

    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> <strong>Trump</strong>'s tariffs are severely disrupting global supply chains, particularly impacting the semiconductor industry and other critical technologies. This creates vulnerabilities for businesses and nations reliant on these goods, potentially leading to shortages and increased prices.  The trend towards resource nationalism further complicates this issue.</div>
