    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>April 28th, 2025, witnessed a confluence of significant global events impacting various populations.  Escalating conflicts in the Middle East and Sudan resulted in substantial civilian casualties and humanitarian crises.  The ongoing blockade of Gaza led to a complete depletion of World Food Programme food stocks, threatening mass starvation.  Meanwhile, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to strain healthcare systems globally, and the rise of AI raised concerns about job displacement and ethical considerations.  Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the US and China in the tech sector and surrounding the Ukraine conflict, further complicated the global landscape.</p>
