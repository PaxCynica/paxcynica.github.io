    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This report outlines three plausible scenarios for 2026-2027, focusing on the interplay between global AI competition (particularly between the US and China) and broader economic instability.  The scenarios consider varying levels of success in AI development, the impact of geopolitical tensions, and the resulting resource allocation shifts.  While significant uncertainty remains, a data-driven approach highlights potential outcomes and key indicators to watch.</p>

          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: US AI Dominance and Global Economic Recovery <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium</span></div>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Significant breakthroughs in US AI development, leading to a technological advantage in key sectors.  Increased international cooperation on AI safety and ethical considerations.  Easing of geopolitical tensions, leading to improved global trade.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong>  US GDP growth above 3%, global trade volume increase of 5%,  Nvidia market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion, reduced global military spending.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Increased foreign investment in US tech firms,  successful international AI safety agreements,  reduction in trade disputes,  positive global consumer confidence.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Continued US government investment in AI research and development,  effective international cooperation on AI governance,  a decline in global conflict.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Increased US global economic and technological influence,  potential for job displacement in other countries,  enhanced global economic stability.</p>

          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong>  Continued intense competition between the US and China in AI development,  no clear technological leader emerges.  Persistent geopolitical tensions, leading to trade disputes and supply chain disruptions. </p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Global GDP growth below 2%,  high inflation rates (above 4%),  volatile stock markets,  increased military spending in multiple regions.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong>  Continued trade disputes between major powers,  cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure,  increased volatility in global financial markets,  escalation of regional conflicts.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>  No significant breakthroughs in AI development by either side,  continued geopolitical rivalry,  failure to reach international agreements on AI governance.</p>
