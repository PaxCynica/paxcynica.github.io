        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Geopolitical tensions are escalating across multiple fronts, driven by factors including the Russia-Ukraine war, the Gaza conflict, and increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. The US-Iran nuclear talks show some progress, but the potential for a deal remains uncertain, with President Trump's threats of military action adding complexity. Economically, Trump's trade war continues to create uncertainty, impacting various sectors and leading to fears of a potential recession.
