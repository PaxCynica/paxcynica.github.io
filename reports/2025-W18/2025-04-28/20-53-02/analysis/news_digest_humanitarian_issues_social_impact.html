  <h2>Key Themes & Analysis</h2>
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Ongoing Conflict and War Crimes in Sudan</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Sudan, Rapid Support Forces (RSF), war crimes, civilian casualties, humanitarian crisis, Darfur</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The ongoing conflict in Sudan continues to cause widespread suffering and displacement.

International intervention is crucial to prevent further suffering and potential mass starvation.</div>
