    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is prompting diverse responses globally.  The US is focusing on antitrust actions against tech giants and promoting domestic AI chip production, driven by concerns about technological dominance and national security.  China is prioritizing its own AI chip development to compete with the US, while also facing challenges in overcoming talent shortages.  India is strategically focusing on leveraging AI for its agricultural sector to enhance food security and farmer prosperity.  These varied approaches reflect differing national priorities, technological capabilities, and geopolitical considerations.</p>

      <div class="comparative-analysis">
        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>United States</h3>
          <p>The US is characterized by a two-pronged approach: aggressive antitrust actions against dominant tech companies like Google, coupled with significant investments in domestic AI chip manufacturing. This strategy aims to maintain US technological leadership, address concerns about monopolies, and bolster national security.  However, this approach may stifle innovation in the short term and faces challenges in securing a sufficient skilled workforce.</p>
