          <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 1: Accelerated AI Dominance <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (60%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong>  A rapid and uneven advancement of AI, particularly in areas like generative AI and agentic AI, leads to significant economic and geopolitical shifts. A few powerful nations and corporations control advanced AI technologies, creating a technological and economic divide.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Global GDP growth driven by AI increases by 15% by 2030 in leading nations, while lagging nations see only 5% growth.  AI-related patents filed in the US and China increase by 500% compared to 2025.  Global AI workforce increases by 30%, concentrated in a few developed countries.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Unfettered AI development, massive investment in AI research, lack of effective international regulation.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Increased concentration of AI talent in a few countries, emergence of AI-driven monopolies, significant widening of the global wealth gap.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Increased geopolitical tensions, potential for AI-driven conflict, exacerbation of social and economic inequalities.</p>
