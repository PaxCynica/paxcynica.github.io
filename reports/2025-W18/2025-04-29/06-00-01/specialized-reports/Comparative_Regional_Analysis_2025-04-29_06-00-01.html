          <h3>United States</h3>
          <p>The US, under President Trump, is characterized by aggressive trade policies (tariffs), military interventions (Yemen), and a confrontational stance towards China. This approach is creating significant global economic uncertainty and fueling regional conflicts.  There are concerns about the long-term consequences of these actions on global stability and the US's own economic health.</p>

          <p>China is responding to US pressure with a focus on technological self-reliance and strategic investments in key sectors like AI and semiconductors.  This includes the development of domestic AI chips to reduce dependence on US technology.  China is also actively seeking alternative trade partners to mitigate the impact of US tariffs.</p>

This reflects a growing trend of resource nationalism and a desire to enhance national security in an increasingly unpredictable world.  The European Union, for example, is actively seeking to reduce its dependence on Russian energy and strengthen its ties with Southeast Asian nations.</p>
