    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Current geopolitical instability, fueled by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and escalating tensions in the Middle East, is significantly impacting global markets and resource allocation.  Simultaneously, rapid advancements in AI and space-based technologies are creating new economic opportunities while exacerbating existing inequalities and security concerns.  Different regions are responding to these intertwined challenges with varying strategies, reflecting their unique economic strengths, political priorities, and technological capabilities.  The US, under President Trump's leadership, is pursuing protectionist trade policies and a more assertive foreign policy, leading to increased global trade tensions. Conversely, China is expanding its technological influence and investing heavily in AI infrastructure.  Europe and other regions are navigating these challenges by focusing on strategic partnerships and technological innovation.</p>

        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>North America (US)</h3>
          <p>The US, under President Trump's administration, is characterized by protectionist trade policies, leading to increased tariffs and trade disputes with China and other nations. This approach prioritizes domestic economic interests, potentially at the expense of global economic cooperation.  The focus is on domestic manufacturing and technological dominance, with significant investment in hypersonic weapons and AI development.  However, this approach also creates vulnerabilities in global supply chains and contributes to geopolitical instability.</p>

          <h3>East Asia (China)</h3>
          <p>China is responding to global instability by strengthening its technological capabilities, particularly in AI and semiconductor manufacturing.  Significant investments in AI infrastructure and research are underway, aiming for technological self-reliance and global competitiveness.  China is also expanding its economic and political influence in regions like Southeast Asia, often in direct competition with US interests. This strategy prioritizes long-term economic growth and technological leadership but also increases geopolitical tensions.</p>
