        <div class="scenario scenario-high">
          <div class="scenario-title">Starlink Dominance <span class="scenario-probability probability-high">Probability: High (60%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> SpaceX achieves a clear market leadership position by year-end, securing a significantly larger subscriber base and market share than Project Kuiper.  This is driven by a faster and more successful satellite deployment, superior technology, and strategic partnerships.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Starlink subscriber count surpasses 10 million; Starlink market share exceeds 70%; Amazon delays further Project Kuiper launches; significant investment in Starlink infrastructure.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Successful and timely Starlink satellite launches; technological advantages in latency and bandwidth; strategic partnerships with telecommunication providers; effective marketing and customer acquisition strategies.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Consistent positive media coverage of Starlink; increased demand for Starlink service; delays in Project Kuiper deployments; decreased investment in Project Kuiper.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> No major technological setbacks for Starlink; continued regulatory support; sustained demand for high-speed internet access.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Increased global internet access; potential for SpaceX to become a dominant player in the global telecommunications market; increased competition in the space launch industry; potential for increased space debris.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-medium">
          <div class="scenario-title">Market Split <span class="scenario-probability probability-medium">Probability: Medium (30%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Both Starlink and Project Kuiper achieve significant market share, resulting in a competitive duopoly.  This scenario is driven by both companies successfully deploying their satellite constellations, but with neither achieving a decisive advantage.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Starlink and Project Kuiper each secure over 5 million subscribers; market share split roughly 50/50; both companies continue significant investment in their respective constellations; intense price competition.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Successful launches for both constellations; comparable technology and service offerings; strong competition in pricing and marketing; regulatory approval for both systems.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Similar subscriber growth for both companies; intense marketing campaigns from both sides; price wars; regulatory decisions impacting both companies equally.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> No major technological failures for either system; regulatory environment remains relatively neutral; sustained demand for space-based internet.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Increased competition and innovation in the space-based internet market; potential for lower prices for consumers; greater global internet access; potential for increased space debris.</p>

        <div class="scenario scenario-low">
          <div class="scenario-title">Project Kuiper Surprise <span class="scenario-probability probability-low">Probability: Low (10%)</span></div>
          <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Amazon's Project Kuiper unexpectedly overtakes Starlink by the end of 2025, achieving market leadership. This is driven by unexpected technological breakthroughs, strategic partnerships, or unforeseen challenges faced by Starlink.</p>
          <p><strong>Quantifiable Indicators:</strong> Project Kuiper subscriber count exceeds 8 million; Project Kuiper market share exceeds 60%; Starlink experiences significant delays or technical issues; significant investment in Project Kuiper infrastructure.</p>
          <p><strong>Drivers:</strong> Unexpected technological advancements in Project Kuiper; strategic partnerships with key players in emerging markets; significant setbacks for Starlink (e.g., launch failures, regulatory hurdles); effective marketing and customer acquisition strategies.</p>
          <p><strong>Signals:</strong> Positive media coverage of Project Kuiper; increasing demand for Project Kuiper service; delays or negative news related to Starlink; increased investment in Project Kuiper.</p>
          <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Major technological breakthroughs for Project Kuiper; significant challenges for Starlink; favorable regulatory environment for Project Kuiper.</p>
          <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Rapid growth in the space-based internet market; potential for Amazon to become a major player in the global telecommunications market; increased competition in the space launch industry; potential for increased space debris.</p>
