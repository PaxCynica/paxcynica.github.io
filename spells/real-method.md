A framework for detecting synthetic media and AI-generated content.

---

## **R – Regularities**
- Look for unnatural patterns in supposedly natural content
- Notice too-perfect regularities or uncanny elements

## **E – Examine Context**
- Check if the content makes sense in its broader context
- Verify if other reliable sources corroborate the content

## **A – Analyze Details**
- Scrutinize small elements that AI often struggles with (hands, teeth, reflections)
- Look for inconsistencies in lighting, physics, or logic

## **L – Leverage Tools**
- Use available technology to help detect synthetic content
- Stay informed about detection techniques as technology evolves

**As synthetic media becomes indistinguishable from reality, stay REAL by developing the skills to detect deception.**
