## **A – Authority & Appeal**
- Is someone leveraging unrelated authority or prestige?
- Are they using emotional appeals instead of evidence?

## **R – Repetition & Rush**
- Is the same message being hammered repeatedly?
- Are you being pressured to decide quickly?

## **M – Misdirection & Muddying**
- Are they changing the subject or creating confusion?
- Is the issue being needlessly complicated or oversimplified?

## **O – Outrage & Overload**
- Is the content designed to trigger strong emotions?
- Are you being overwhelmed with information?

## **R – Reinforcement & Reward**
- Does it strongly validate existing beliefs or biases?
- Is there a psychological reward for accepting the message?
