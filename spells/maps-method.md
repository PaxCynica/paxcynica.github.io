## **M – Mark the Territory**
- Identify where genuine disagreement lies versus perceived conflict
- Map the actual spectrum of positions, not just extremes

## **A – Acknowledge Complexity**
- Resist oversimplification of nuanced issues
- Recognize legitimate tensions between competing values

## **P – Pause Partisanship**
- Temporarily suspend team-based thinking
- Examine issues based on principles rather than alignment

## **S – Seek Understanding**
- Prioritize clarity over persuasion initially
- Build accurate models of different positions before judging
