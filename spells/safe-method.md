# SAFE: Rapid Media Triage Checklist

A quick, under-fire method for evaluating news, social posts, or spoken claims in real time.

---

## **S – Source & Story**
- Who is telling me this?
- What is the evidence or basis for the claim?

## **A – Agenda**
- Who benefits if I believe or share this?
- Am I being pushed to act or react quickly?

## **F – Frame & Feeling**
- How is this being presented or framed?
- What emotion is it trying to trigger in me?

## **E – Echo & Evidence**
- Is this being widely repeated or amplified?
- Can I verify it with independent, credible sources?

**When in doubt, go SAFE before you share.**
