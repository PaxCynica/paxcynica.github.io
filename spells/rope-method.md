# ROPE: Restraining Our Personal Excesses

A framework for developing self-discipline in information consumption and sharing.

---

## **R – Recognize**
- Acknowledge your emotional triggers and cognitive biases
- Identify when you're being pulled toward reactive behavior

## **O – Observe**
- Create mental distance between stimulus and response
- Watch your impulses without immediately acting on them

## **P – Pause**
- Implement deliberate waiting periods before responding
- Allow time for emotional reactions to settle before deciding

## **E – Evaluate**
- Assess the potential consequences of your information actions
- Consider how your contributions shape the information environment

**When impulses threaten wise decisions, use ROPE to anchor yourself to reason.**
