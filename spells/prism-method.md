# PRISM: Pattern Recognition In Social Media

A framework for detecting coordinated information manipulation campaigns.

---

## **P – Proliferation**
- Track sudden spreads of identical or nearly-identical content
- Notice unnatural acceleration in sharing patterns

## **R – Resonance**
- Identify emotional triggers being consistently activated
- Observe which narratives gain unusual traction and why

## **I – Inauthenticity**
- Spot artificial behaviors (botlike timing, odd language patterns)
- Recognize mass-produced content disguised as organic

## **S – Synchronization**
- Note multiple sources suddenly pushing the same narrative
- Identify coordinated timing across seemingly unrelated channels

## **M – Motivation**
- Ask who benefits from this information pattern
- Trace campaigns to potential strategic objectives

**Use your PRISM to disperse light on what appears to be organic but may be orchestrated.**
