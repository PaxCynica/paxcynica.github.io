## Media Literacy Triage Checklist

**1. Who Benefits?**
- Who gains if I believe or share this?
- Is someone’s reputation, power, or profit at stake?

**2. What is the Frame?**
- How is the issue being presented?
- What’s being emphasized or left out?
- What language or imagery is used to trigger emotion?

**3. Source and Evidence**
- Who is the original source?
- Is the evidence based on verifiable facts, data, expert consensus, or primary sources?
- Are sources clearly cited?
- Can I verify this with independent sources?

**4. Emotional Reaction**
- What feelings does this provoke in me?
- Am I being nudged to outrage, fear, or tribal loyalty?
- Is my critical thinking being bypassed by strong emotion?

**5. Information Gaps**
- What’s missing or not being said?
- Are alternative viewpoints or facts ignored?

**6. Platform/Algorithm Influence**
- Why am I seeing this now?
- Is this being amplified by an algorithm or trending artificially?

**7. Manipulation Tactics**
- Are there attempts to distort information or exploit vulnerabilities in my thinking?
- Are there signs of manipulation (e.g., repetition, loaded language, false binaries, scapegoating)?
- Is this trying to polarize or divide?

**8. Action Urgency**
- Am I being pressured to act or share quickly?
- Would waiting or fact-checking change my response?

**9. Personal Bias**
- Does this confirm what I already believe?
- Am I open to being wrong or learning more?

**10. Community & Expert Check**
- Have I discussed this with others I trust?
- Have I consulted credible experts or organizations with a track record of fact-checking and analysis?
- What do diverse, credible sources say?

**11. Timeliness**
- Has this information been updated or retracted by the original source or fact-checkers?
- Is it still current and relevant?

**Pause. Verify. Reflect.**  
Don’t let urgency or emotion override your judgment. In a hostile information environment, skepticism and slow thinking are your best defense.
