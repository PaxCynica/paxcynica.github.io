# LOGIC: Leveraging Or Guarding against Intelligent Computation

A framework for critically engaging with AI-mediated information.

---

## **L – Limits**
- Understand the constraints and limitations of AI systems
- Recognize where human judgment remains essential

## **O – Origins**
- Consider how training data shapes AI outputs
- Identify potential inherited biases or blindspots

## **G – Goals**
- Ask what objectives are optimized in the system
- Consider whose interests the AI ultimately serves

## **I – Interrogate**
- Question AI-generated information rather than accepting it
- Test AI outputs against other reliable sources

## **C – Complement**
- Use AI as a supplement to human reasoning, not a replacement
- Enhance your thinking with AI while maintaining critical judgment

**As AI reshapes our information landscape, apply LOGIC to harness its benefits while guarding against its risks.**
