      <h2>US-China Tech & Trade Competition: Future Scenarios</h2>

      <h3>Scenario 1: Tech Cold War Intensifies</h3>
      <p><b>Description:</b> This scenario envisions a further fracturing of the global technology landscape, with the US and China decoupling their tech sectors and establishing competing standards and ecosystems.</p>
      <p><b>Key Assumptions:</b> The US continues to impose stringent export controls on advanced technologies to China. China prioritizes technological self-sufficiency and invests heavily in domestic alternatives. Diplomatic relations between the US and China remain strained.</p>
      <p><b>Potential Outcomes:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased costs for businesses operating in both markets due to duplicated R&D and supply chain inefficiencies.</li>
        <li>Slower pace of technological innovation as collaboration decreases and standards diverge.</li>
        <li>Emergence of two distinct technology spheres, potentially leading to geopolitical instability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Quantifiable Indicators:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Indicator:</b> Number of US export licenses denied for technology exports to China. <b>Threshold:</b> >20% increase year-over-year.</li>
        <li><b>Indicator:</b> Investment in China's domestic semiconductor industry. <b>Threshold:</b> >15% annual growth.</li>
        <li><b>Indicator:</b> Number of joint US-China research projects terminated or suspended. <b>Threshold:</b> >10% increase year-over-year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Drivers & Signals:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Further expansion of the US Entity List to include more Chinese tech companies.</li>
        <li>China's announcement of new industrial policies aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in critical technologies.</li>
        <li>Increased cyber espionage activities targeting intellectual property.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Potential Consequences:</b> Fragmentation of the global internet, reduced access to technology for developing nations, increased risk of military conflict due to technological rivalry.</p>

      <h3>Scenario 2: Uneasy Coexistence and Limited Cooperation</h3>
      <p><b>Description:</b> This scenario portrays a situation where the US and China manage to avoid a complete tech decoupling, but cooperation remains limited and fraught with tension. Competition persists, but both sides recognize the need for some level of collaboration on issues of mutual concern.</p>
      <p><b>Key Assumptions:</b> Both the US and China recognize the economic costs of a full-scale tech war. Limited dialogue is maintained on issues like climate change and global health. Targeted sanctions and export controls remain in place, but are not expanded significantly.</p>
      <p><b>Potential Outcomes:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continued competition in key technology sectors, such as AI and 5G, but with some areas of cooperation.</li>
        <li>Selective decoupling of supply chains, with companies diversifying their sourcing to reduce reliance on either country.</li>
        <li>Geopolitical tensions remain elevated, but are managed through diplomacy and communication.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Quantifiable Indicators:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Indicator:</b> Volume of trade in technology goods between the US and China. <b>Threshold:</b> +/- 5% change year-over-year.</li>
        <li><b>Indicator:</b> Number of US-China bilateral meetings on technology and trade issues. <b>Threshold:</b> Maintained at current levels (2-3 per year).</li>
        <li><b>Indicator:</b> Investment in supply chain diversification by multinational corporations. <b>Threshold:</b> >8% annual growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Drivers & Signals:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public statements from US and Chinese leaders emphasizing the importance of dialogue and cooperation.</li>
        <li>Negotiation of limited trade agreements addressing specific areas of concern.</li>
        <li>Increased efforts to combat cybercrime and protect intellectual property.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Potential Consequences:</b> Slower economic growth due to trade frictions, continued uncertainty for businesses, limited progress on global challenges requiring international cooperation.</p>

      <h3>Scenario 3: China's Technological Dominance</h3>
      <p><b>Description:</b> In this scenario, China successfully leverages its state-led industrial policies, vast domestic market, and aggressive technology acquisition strategies to achieve global dominance in key technology sectors.</p>
      <p><b>Key Assumptions:</b> The US struggles to maintain its technological lead due to underinvestment in research and development, skills shortages, and regulatory hurdles. China continues to invest heavily in strategic technologies and expands its influence through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
      <p><b>Potential Outcomes:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>China becomes the global leader in key technology sectors, such as AI, 5G, and electric vehicles.</li>
        <li>US companies lose market share and competitiveness, leading to economic decline and job losses.</li>
        <li>China's technological dominance translates into increased geopolitical influence and the ability to shape global standards and norms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Quantifiable Indicators:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Indicator:</b> China's share of global patents in strategic technology sectors. <b>Threshold:</b> >40%</li>
        <li><b>Indicator:</b> US trade deficit in technology goods with China. <b>Threshold:</b> >$500 billion annually.</li>
        <li><b>Indicator:</b> Number of countries adopting Chinese technology standards and infrastructure. <b>Threshold:</b> >20% increase in countries using Chinese 5G equipment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Drivers & Signals:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Significant breakthroughs in China's domestic semiconductor industry.</li>
        <li>Widespread adoption of Chinese digital platforms and technologies in developing countries.</li>
        <li>Erosion of US leadership in international technology standards organizations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Potential Consequences:</b> Shift in the global balance of power, decline of US economic and political influence, increased adoption of authoritarian technologies and governance models.</p>
