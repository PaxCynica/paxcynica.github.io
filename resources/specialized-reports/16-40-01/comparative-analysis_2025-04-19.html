    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This report analyzes the differing approaches of the United States, China, and the European Union to trade and technology, particularly focusing on tariffs, technology development, and regulatory actions. The analysis highlights the contrasting strategies each entity employs to achieve economic and strategic objectives, considering the implications of these actions on the global landscape.</p>

        <h3>United States</h3>
        <p>The US, under the Trump administration, continues to employ tariffs as a primary tool in trade negotiations, particularly with China and the EU. The focus is on "America First" policies, aiming to protect domestic industries and renegotiate trade deals perceived as unfavorable. There's also a strong push for domestic mining of rare earths and critical minerals to reduce reliance on China. The US is actively involved in developing space-based missile defense systems and fostering technological collaboration with countries like India. The administration's confrontational approach towards the Federal Reserve raises concerns about economic stability. A potential shift in foreign policy is evident with the US signaling a possible withdrawal from Ukraine-Russia peace efforts.</p>
        <p><b>Motivations:</b> Protecting domestic industries, reducing trade deficits, achieving energy independence, maintaining technological superiority, and asserting global influence.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="comparison-column">
        <h3>China</h3>
        <p>China is actively seeking to counter US influence through diplomatic and economic maneuvering, particularly in Southeast Asia. They are promoting economic alliances, resisting protectionism, and expanding their military presence, especially naval power. China faces allegations of supplying weapons to Russia, escalating tensions with Ukraine and potentially inviting further sanctions. Domestically, China is pushing for technological self-sufficiency, exemplified by advancements in AI, EV battery technology, and strict safety mandates. China's export controls on rare earths and its growing military influence are reshaping the global order.</p>
        <p><b>Motivations:</b> Expanding economic and political influence, countering US hegemony, securing access to resources, promoting technological innovation, and protecting national interests.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="comparison-column">
        <h3>European Union</h3>
        <p>The EU is navigating a complex landscape of trade tensions and regulatory actions. While engaging in trade talks with the US, the EU also considers fines against US tech giants like Apple and Meta, highlighting its commitment to enforcing the Digital Markets Act. The EU faces an energy dilemma, balancing reliance on Russian gas with geopolitical resolve. The EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy, especially in technology and energy, is being tested by these geopolitical realities. The EU is also taking steps to enhance its naval presence in the Baltic Sea in coordination with NATO.</p>
        <p><b>Motivations:</b> Protecting European businesses, promoting fair competition, ensuring energy security, asserting regulatory authority, and maintaining transatlantic relationships while pursuing strategic autonomy.</p>

    <h2>Implications & Significance</h2>
    <p>The divergent approaches of the US, China, and the EU have significant implications for the global economy and geopolitical stability. The US's protectionist policies and trade wars could lead to stagflation and a loss of confidence in the US dollar. China's growing influence and military buildup challenge the existing global order, potentially leading to increased tensions. The EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy impacts transatlantic relations and its role in global affairs. The interplay of these factors will shape the future of trade, technology, and international relations.</p>
