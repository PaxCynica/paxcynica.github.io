      <h2>Comparative Analysis: Responding to Trade Tensions</h2>
      <p>The current global economic landscape is characterized by heightened trade tensions, primarily driven by the United States' aggressive tariff policies. This analysis compares the responses of the US, China, and the EU to these challenges.</p>

      <div class="comparative-analysis">
        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>United States</h3>
          <p><strong>Approach:</strong> The US administration, led by President Trump, is aggressively employing tariffs as a tool to achieve trade concessions and protect domestic industries. This "America First" strategy is creating significant economic uncertainty and raising concerns about potential stagflation.</p>
          <p><strong>Economic Motivations:</strong> The primary motivations appear to be boosting domestic manufacturing, reducing trade deficits, and exerting leverage in trade negotiations. However, these policies are also driven by a desire to appeal to a protectionist voter base.</p>
          <p><strong>Market Implications:</strong> The implementation of tariffs is triggering concerns about rising inflation and slower economic growth, leading to market volatility and a potential loss of confidence in the US dollar. Investors are showing signs of losing trust in the US economy's long-term stability.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Data Points:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reports indicate a growing threat of stagflation due to US tariffs.</li>
            <li>The US dollar is experiencing a sell-off, suggesting declining investor confidence.</li>
            <li>The Trump administration continues to clash with the Federal Reserve over interest rate policies.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>China</h3>
          <p><strong>Approach:</strong> China is responding to US tariffs with a combination of diplomatic maneuvering, strategic investment in technology, and efforts to build economic alliances in Southeast Asia. The aim is to counter US influence and reshape the global order.</p>
          <p><strong>Economic Motivations:</strong> China's actions are driven by a desire to protect its economic interests, maintain access to global markets, and reduce reliance on US technology. The country is also focused on achieving technological self-sufficiency in key sectors like AI and electric vehicles.</p>
          <p><strong>Market Implications:</strong> China's increasing military and economic power is challenging US dominance in the Indo-Pacific region. The country is also facing scrutiny over its trade practices and alleged support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict, potentially leading to further sanctions.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Data Points:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>China is actively seeking to build economic alliances in Southeast Asia.</li>
            <li>The country is investing heavily in domestic AI and EV battery technology.</li>
            <li>There are accusations of China supplying weapons to Russia, leading to sanctions from Ukraine.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="comparative-column">
          <h3>European Union</h3>
          <p><strong>Approach:</strong> The EU is attempting to balance its trade relations with the US and China while also enforcing its own regulatory standards, particularly through the Digital Markets Act. This approach reflects a desire for strategic autonomy and a commitment to fair competition.</p>
          <p><strong>Economic Motivations:</strong> The EU's primary motivation is to protect its economic interests, promote fair competition in the digital market, and maintain its regulatory independence. The EU also faces the challenge of energy security and reliance on Russian gas.</p>
          <p><strong>Market Implications:</strong> The EU's regulatory actions against US tech giants like Apple and Meta are being weighed against the backdrop of ongoing trade negotiations with the US. The EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy is also being tested by geopolitical realities and energy dependencies.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Data Points:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The EU has postponed fines for Apple and Meta amid US trade disputes.</li>
            <li>The EU is grappling with the dilemma of balancing energy security with geopolitical resolve.</li>
            <li>The EU is facing challenges in enforcing its own regulations due to trade considerations.</li>
