  <h2>Major Themes & Key Trends</h2>

  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Israel-Palestine Conflict: Deepening Gaza Crisis and International Pressure</h3>
    <p>The humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate sharply, with Israel maintaining its blockade and reportedly using aid as a "pressure lever." Dozens, including children, were killed in recent strikes on tent camps, even in designated "safe zones." International calls for a ceasefire persist (e.g., French President Macron), while the human cost is highlighted by the World Press Photo award going to an image of an injured Gazan boy. Israel's defense minister stated troops will remain indefinitely in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, signaling a hardening stance.</p>

    <p class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The worsening humanitarian crisis and lack of a ceasefire increase the risk of broader regional instability and further international condemnation of Israel's actions. The indefinite occupation plans complicate any future peace prospects and raise questions about long-term governance in Gaza.</p>

    <h3>2. US Trade Policy Impacts: Tariffs, Business Adjustments, and ASEAN Response</h3>
    <p>The impact of US tariffs continues to ripple through global commerce. Companies like Shein and Temu are warning US customers of imminent price hikes due to tariffs. This trade pressure is influencing international investment flows, with wealthy Chinese buyers reportedly shifting focus from the US to Thai property. ASEAN nations, including Thailand, are considering a united front in negotiations with the US over these tariffs.</p>

    <h3>3. China's Regional Influence and Ongoing Tech Competition</h3>
    <p>China continues to exert influence in Southeast Asia, with President Xi Jinping visiting Cambodia seeking financial support amid the US tariff war. Beijing's stance on Taiwan remains firm, drawing protests from Taipei over a joint China-Vietnam statement. The US-China tech rivalry persists, evident in competition over cloud data storage dominance and Chinese developers eyeing the US market for low-altitude aircraft despite tariffs. Taiwan's TSMC remains a key player, with high profit expectations.</p>

    <h3>5. African Business Landscape and Geopolitical Interests</h3>
    <p>The business environment in Africa sees shifts, with PwC exiting operations in nine Sub-Saharan countries to focus on other growth markets. Conversely, Russia is increasing its presence, with dozens of tech firms participating in the GITEX Africa exhibition in Morocco. Geopolitical interests are also evident, with the US potentially eyeing mineral resources in the Congo amid conflict and considering embassy closures elsewhere on the continent. Morocco is also potentially purchasing Stinger missiles from the US.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Monitor the Gaza aid situation closely; any significant changes (increase/decrease/routes) could signal shifts in Israeli policy or international pressure effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Track consumer price index data in the US and globally for impacts related to tariffs on goods from companies like Shein/Temu.</li>
    <li>Observe outcomes of Xi Jinping's Southeast Asia tour for specific agreements (financial, infrastructure, trade) indicating China's success in strengthening regional ties.</li>
    <li>Follow developments related to the Malaysia-Myanmar talks for any potential breakthroughs or shifts in ASEAN's approach to the crisis.</li>
    <li>Watch for further announcements regarding US diplomatic and commercial interests in Africa, particularly concerning critical minerals and security partnerships.</li>
    <li>Assess reports from Hong Kong financial institutions regarding non-performing loans as an indicator of the real economic impact of US-China trade tensions on the region.</li>
