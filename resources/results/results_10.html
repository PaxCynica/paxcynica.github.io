    <h1>News Data Analysis: Emerging Trends in Conflict, Diplomacy, Technology, and Humanitarian Affairs</h1>
    <h2>Major Themes & Key Trends</h2>

    <div class="theme">
        <h3>1. Humanitarian Crises and Foreign Aid Cuts</h3>
        <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> humanitarian assistance, foreign aid, polio resurgence, Sudan, Gaza, health workers, pandemic preparedness</div>
        <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Foreign aid cuts by wealthy nations, especially the US, are threatening global health and humanitarian efforts. There are rising concerns about a polio comeback in Afghanistan and Pakistan, worsening crises in Sudan (with millions of children in need), and catastrophic conditions in Gaza due to ongoing conflict and aid blockades. The international community is struggling to respond, with new agreements on pandemic preparedness but limited resources for immediate crises.</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Could polio be poised for a comeback?</li>
            <li>Foreign Assistance Cuts Hamper Community Health Workers And Patients</li>
            <li>Sudan: 15 million children require humanitarian assistance after two years of war</li>
            <li>Gaza faces 'worst' humanitarian crisis since October 2023: U.N.</li>
            <li>WHO countries reach landmark agreement on tackling future pandemics</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="theme">
        <h3>2. Ongoing Conflicts and Ceasefire Challenges</h3>
        <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Gaza, Ukraine, ceasefire, peace talks, military operations, hostages, Lebanon, Syria, Myanmar</div>
        <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, Lebanon, and Myanmar continue to escalate or remain unresolved. Ceasefire efforts are stalling, with Israel maintaining military presence in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, and Ukraine prolonging martial law amid heavy fighting. Civilian casualties and infrastructure destruction are mounting, and peace negotiations face significant obstacles.</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Israel’s demand that Hamas disarm is a “distraction”</li>
            <li>Ukraine prolongs martial law amid Russian air attacks, heavy ground battles</li>
            <li>Israeli defense minister says troops will remain in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely</li>
            <li>Myanmar earthquake relief hampered by lack of aid, airstrikes</li>
            <li>Hamas says 'lost contact' with group holding American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="theme">
        <h3>3. Geopolitical Tensions and Diplomatic Maneuvering</h3>
        <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> diplomatic relations, China, Malaysia, Lithuania, NATO, UN, peace agreements, sanctions</div>
        <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Diplomatic relations are in flux, with Lithuania seeking to restore ties with China, China engaging in Southeast Asian diplomacy, and NATO reaffirming commitments in Eastern Europe. The US is considering major cuts to NATO and UN funding, and peace agreements (e.g., Armenia-Azerbaijan) are being facilitated by regional powers. Sanctions, trade wars, and diplomatic summits are shaping the global order.</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Lithuanian PM seeks to restore diplomatic relations with China</li>
            <li>China's Xi expresses commitment to enhancing cooperation with Malaysia</li>
            <li>NATO chief rules out Ukraine membership in peace deal</li>
            <li>US considering ‘eliminating almost all funding’ for NATO – NYT</li>
            <li>Iran ready to facilitate signing of Armenia-Azerbaijan peace treaty</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="theme">
        <h3>4. Military Modernization, Autonomous Weapons, and Technology</h3>
        <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> AI military applications, autonomous weapons, drones, fiber optics, submarines, 5G, data transfer, defense budgets</div>
        <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Military modernization is accelerating, with investments in AI, drones, submarines, and advanced communications. The submarine market is growing due to geopolitical tensions, and new technologies (like high-speed infrared data transfer) are being developed. Defense budgets and procurement are under scrutiny as nations balance modernization with fiscal constraints.</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Hidden Killers: Inside Ukraine’s Combat Drone Statistics</li>
            <li>Submarines Market Set to Reach $24.44 Billion by 2029 Amidst Geopolitical Tensions</li>
            <li>Eindhoven researchers achieve 5.7 Tb/s data transfer speeds using highly focused infrared light</li>
            <li>FWA Expansion Signals Path To 5G Monetization And Competition</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="theme">
        <h3>5. Blockades, Human Rights, and War Crimes</h3>
        <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> humanitarian aid, blockades, war crimes, Gaza, Lebanon, civilian casualties, international law</div>
        <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Human rights violations and war crimes are under intense scrutiny, particularly in Gaza and Lebanon. Blockades and strikes are causing mass casualties and infrastructure collapse. International organizations and media are documenting abuses, and calls for accountability and humanitarian access are growing louder.</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Gaza ‘mass grave’ for Palestinians and those helping them: MSF</li>
            <li>Israeli soldiers filmed themselves destroying Gaza: See the video evidence</li>
            <li>Israeli strikes in Lebanon continue to kill civilians, UN rights office warns</li>
            <li>Israel says no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="theme">
        <h3>6. Economic and Social Impacts of Conflict</h3>
        <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> sanctions, trade wars, economic downturn, infrastructure, migration, prison overcrowding</div>
        <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Conflicts and sanctions are causing economic hardship, infrastructure damage, and migration crises. Countries are seeking new trade partners and investment, while social issues like prison overcrowding (e.g., Denmark sending prisoners to Kosovo) and the role of people in infrastructure development are gaining attention.</div>
        <ul class="examples">
            <li>Project Syndicate: America Self-Destructs (on tariffs and global power)</li>
            <li>Denmark tackles prison overcrowding by sending the prisoners to Kosovo</li>
