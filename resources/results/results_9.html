  <h2>Major Themes & Key Trends</h2>

  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. The Growing Threat of Drone Warfare</h3>
    <p>Drones are increasingly shaping modern warfare, as evidenced by their widespread use in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and elsewhere. Ukrainian soldiers are struggling to differentiate between friendly and enemy drones, leading to widespread jamming. Denmark is establishing a military drone testing center, and ZenaTech is showcasing AI drone innovation for commercial and defense markets.</p>
    <p class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> drones, drone warfare, Ukraine, electronic warfare, AI, ZenaTech, Denmark</p>

    <h3>5. The Growing Problem of Space Junk</h3>
    <p>The amount of space junk in Earth's orbit is increasing, posing a threat to satellites and future space missions. Over 6,600 tons of space junk are currently floating around in Earth's orbit, creating a massive orbital junk problem. This debris can collide with satellites, causing damage and creating even more space junk.</p>
    <p class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> space junk, satellites, orbital debris, space missions, ESA</p>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://newatlas.com/space/6-600-tons-space-junk-earth-orbit/">Over 6,600 tons of space junk are floating around in Earth's orbit</a> (New Atlas)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The growing problem of space junk could make it more difficult and dangerous to operate satellites and conduct space missions. International efforts are needed to track and remove space junk.</p>
