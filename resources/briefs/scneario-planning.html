    <h1>Scenario Planning: The Future of US-China AI and Technology Competition</h1>

    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>Scenario 1: Decoupled Tech Ecosystems</h2>
        <h3>Assumptions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The US and China continue to escalate export controls, investment restrictions, and regulatory barriers.</li>
            <li>Both countries invest heavily in domestic AI and semiconductor industries, aiming for self-sufficiency.</li>
            <li>International collaboration on technology standards and research declines.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Consequences &amp; Implications:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The world splits into two largely separate technology spheres, each with its own standards, platforms, and supply chains.</li>
            <li>Global innovation slows as talent and resources are duplicated, and cross-border collaboration becomes rare.</li>
            <li>Smaller countries and companies are forced to choose sides or struggle to operate in both ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Security risks increase as both sides race to integrate AI into military systems, raising the potential for misunderstandings or escalation.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>Scenario 2: Managed Competition with Selective Collaboration</h2>
        <h3>Assumptions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>While rivalry remains, the US and China recognize the risks of total decoupling and agree to limited cooperation in key areas (e.g., AI safety, climate modeling, pandemic response).</li>
            <li>International organizations and third-party countries (EU, Japan, India) help broker agreements on standards and best practices.</li>
            <li>Export controls and investment restrictions remain, but are targeted rather than sweeping.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Consequences &amp; Implications:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Innovation continues, though at a somewhat slower pace than in a fully open system.</li>
            <li>Shared challenges—like AI safety and climate change—see some progress through joint initiatives.</li>
            <li>Tensions persist, but guardrails reduce the risk of accidental escalation or technological fragmentation.</li>
            <li>Countries and companies have more flexibility to operate across both spheres, though with some constraints.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>Scenario 3: Renewed Global Cooperation</h2>
        <h3>Assumptions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A major crisis (e.g., a dangerous AI incident or global economic shock) prompts the US, China, and other powers to reset relations and prioritize cooperation.</li>
            <li>New international frameworks are established for AI governance, data sharing, and technology standards.</li>
            <li>Export controls and restrictions are eased in favor of transparency and joint oversight.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Consequences &amp; Implications:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Global innovation accelerates as talent, data, and resources flow more freely.</li>
            <li>Risks from AI misuse or accidents are reduced through shared safety protocols and rapid information exchange.</li>
            <li>Economic growth and social benefits are more widely distributed, but some national security concerns remain.</li>
            <li>Trust in international institutions is strengthened, though maintaining cooperation requires ongoing effort and compromise.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Summary:</strong>
        <p>
            The future of US-China AI and technology competition could range from deepening division to cautious collaboration or even renewed partnership. The path taken will depend on political choices, unforeseen crises, and the ability of global actors to balance competition with the need for shared progress and security.
