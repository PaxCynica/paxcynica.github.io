  <h2>Major Themes & Key Trends</h2>
  <!-- Repeat for each theme -->
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Potential Shift in GOP Tax Policy</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Republican Party, tax hike, wealthy, Grover Norquist, anti-tax, economics, politics.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> This development could signal a significant ideological shift within the Republican Party, potentially impacting wealth distribution, economic policy, and voter alignment. A tax hike on the wealthy could alleviate budget deficits but might face resistance from traditional Republican constituencies and donors. Second-order effects could include changes in investment strategies and philanthropic activities of high-net-worth individuals.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/norquist-trump-tax-wealthy/682493/">Is the GOP About to Raise Taxes?</a></li>
    </ul>

  <!-- End repeat -->
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>2. State Department Human Rights Reporting Changes</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> State Department, human rights reports, prison conditions, political corruption, abuses, Trump administration, scaling back, critiques.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Changes to State Department human rights reporting could lead to a less comprehensive understanding of global human rights issues. The omission of certain critiques may weaken diplomatic efforts to address abuses and could be perceived as a tacit endorsement of certain regimes. Second-order effects might include reduced international pressure on countries with questionable human rights records and a decline in the credibility of U.S. foreign policy.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/18/nx-s1-5357511/state-department-human-rights-report-cuts">The State Department is changing its mind about what it calls human rights</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="theme">
    <h3>3. Tensions with Iran and Potential for War</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> US, Iran, nuclear ambitions, boiling point, full-scale war, adversary, standoff.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Escalating tensions between the US and Iran raise the specter of military conflict, which could destabilize the Middle East and disrupt global energy markets. A full-scale war could have devastating humanitarian consequences and trigger a broader regional conflict. Second-order effects could include increased geopolitical instability, heightened cybersecurity threats, and significant economic repercussions.</div>
    <ul class="examples">

    <div class="theme">
    <h3>4. Europe's Energy Dependence on Russia</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Europe, energy, Russian gas, geopolitical resolve, economic desperation, strategic autonomy, U.S.-EU ties.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Europe's continued reliance on Russian gas creates a significant geopolitical vulnerability, potentially undermining its ability to pursue independent foreign policy objectives. The prospect of resuming Russian gas imports highlights the tension between economic needs and geopolitical considerations. Second-order effects could include strained transatlantic relations, increased investment in alternative energy sources, and a reshaping of European security alliances.</div>

    <div class="theme">
    <h3>5. Healthcare Fraud and Illegal Distribution of Controlled Substances</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Indian-origin doctor, convicted, health care fraud, conspiracies, US, controlled substances, Justice Department.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Convictions related to healthcare fraud and illegal distribution of controlled substances highlight ongoing challenges in combating criminal activity within the healthcare system. Such cases erode public trust and contribute to rising healthcare costs. Second-order effects may include stricter regulations, increased scrutiny of healthcare professionals, and a greater emphasis on combating the opioid crisis.</div>
