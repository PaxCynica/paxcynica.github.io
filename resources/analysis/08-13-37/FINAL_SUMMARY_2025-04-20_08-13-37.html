    <div class="critical-theme">
        <h3>Escalation of Israeli-Palestinian Conflict and Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza</h3>
        <p>Intensified Israeli strikes on Gaza have resulted in a sharp rise in casualties and a deepening humanitarian crisis, with limited access to essential resources.  The blockade of aid and ongoing conflict raise concerns about potential war crimes and a looming famine.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Over 90 killed in Gaza due to Israeli strikes.</li>
            <li>UNRWA reports a complete Israeli blockade preventing aid delivery.</li>

    <h2>Potential Scenarios</h2>
    <div class="scenarios">
        <h3>Scenario 1: Diplomatic Breakthrough</h3>
        <p>The US and Iran reach a new nuclear agreement, leading to de-escalation in the Middle East.  Simultaneously, progress is made in the Ukraine-Russia peace talks, reducing tensions in Eastern Europe.  These positive developments create a more stable global environment and facilitate international cooperation on other pressing issues.</p>

        <h3>Scenario 2: Escalation of Conflicts</h3>
        <p>The US-Iran nuclear talks fail, leading to increased tensions and a potential arms race in the Middle East.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict escalates further, drawing in regional actors.  US recognition of Crimea as Russian territory exacerbates the Ukraine conflict and strains relations with European allies.  This scenario leads to a more volatile and dangerous global environment.</p>

        <h3>Scenario 3: Technological Disruption and Geopolitical Competition</h3>
        <p>Rapid advancements in quantum computing and AI lead to significant technological disruptions and intensify geopolitical competition.  The US and China engage in a technological arms race, leading to further decoupling of their economies and increased tensions.  The proliferation of drone technology and other advanced weapons systems creates new security challenges and raises the risk of conflict.</p>
