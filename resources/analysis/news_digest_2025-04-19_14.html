  <h2>Analyst’s Guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Monitor the evolving political landscape in the US, particularly the strategies and narratives employed by both the administration and the opposition. Pay close attention to the impact of policies on civil liberties and democratic institutions.</li>
    <li>Track the escalating tensions in the Middle East, especially the ongoing conflict in Yemen and its implications for regional stability and global trade. Assess the potential for broader military escalation.</li>
    <li>Analyze the social and political unrest in various countries, focusing on the underlying causes and the potential for these movements to effect meaningful change or face government crackdowns.</li>
    <li>Follow the debate surrounding free speech and hate speech laws, particularly in the context of international trade negotiations. Consider the potential impact on freedom of expression and online content regulation.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to actions taken against universities and civil society groups. Monitor any attempts to limit academic freedom or restrict the activities of organizations critical of the government.</li>
