  <h2>Major Themes & Key Trends</h2>
  
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Shifting COVID-19 Narrative and Public Health Information</h3>
    <p>The US government's approach to COVID-19 information seems to have changed. The primary government website, covid.gov, has been repurposed to promote the "lab leak" theory of the virus's origin and criticize past pandemic policies. This shift raises questions about the integrity of public health communication and the potential for politicization of scientific information.</p>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> COVID-19, lab leak theory, public health, government website, misinformation.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> This shift could erode public trust in scientific institutions and hinder future pandemic responses. It could also fuel international tensions, particularly with China, and influence public health policies in ways not supported by scientific consensus.</div>
    <ul class="examples">

    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>2. Controversy Surrounding RFK Jr.'s Stance on Autism</h3>
    <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing criticism for his views on autism, particularly his emphasis on environmental factors and skepticism toward vaccine safety. His statements have sparked debate and concern among autism advocates and scientists who argue that his rhetoric is harmful and misrepresents scientific understanding.</p>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> RFK Jr., autism, vaccines, environmental factors, public health, misinformation.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> RFK Jr.'s position could negatively affect public health initiatives related to vaccination and autism research. His views may also reinforce harmful stereotypes and undermine efforts to support autistic individuals and their families.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kelley_greene/woman-calls-out-rfkjr-for-comments-on-autism">People Are Cheering On This Woman With AuDHD For Calling Out RFK Jr. Over His Comments About Autism</a></li>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="theme">
    <h3>3. Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza</h3>
    <p>Reports indicate a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with children surviving on limited food and aid groups struggling to provide assistance due to ongoing conflict. The long-term effects of the conflict on the population, particularly children, are raising serious concerns.</p>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Gaza, children, famine, aid, war crimes, Israeli attack, humanitarian law.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The situation in Gaza has severe long-term implications for the physical and mental health of the population, especially children. It could also lead to increased regional instability and further erosion of international humanitarian law.</div>
    <ul class="examples">

    </ul>
  </div>

    <div class="theme">
    <h3>4. Political Exploitation of Immigration Issues</h3>
    <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man wrongly deported to El Salvador, is being used as a political flashpoint. Accusations of human trafficking and gang affiliation are being leveled against him, while some politicians are using his case to highlight broader immigration policy debates. This case underscores the dangers of misinformation and the weaponization of immigration issues.</p>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Deportation, human trafficking, MS-13, immigration policy, misinformation, political polarization.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The exploitation of immigration cases for political gain can lead to the dehumanization of individuals and further exacerbate social divisions. It also risks undermining due process and the fair treatment of immigrants.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/18/us-news/alleged-ms-13-gangbanger-kilmar-abrego-garcia-suspected-of-human-trafficking-feds-say/">Alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia suspected of human trafficking, feds say</a></li>

    </ul>
  </div>
  
    <div class="theme">
    <h3>5. Erosion of Humanitarian Law and International Norms</h3>
    <p>Several articles suggest a concerning trend of eroding humanitarian law and international norms. This includes the perceived impunity of certain nations in conflict zones, the suppression of Christianity in its birthplace, and the normalization of actions that violate fundamental human rights.</p>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Humanitarian law, war crimes, genocide, human rights violations, international norms, impunity.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The erosion of humanitarian law undermines the foundations of international cooperation and can lead to increased violence and suffering. It also creates a dangerous precedent for future conflicts and weakens the ability of international organizations to protect vulnerable populations.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
