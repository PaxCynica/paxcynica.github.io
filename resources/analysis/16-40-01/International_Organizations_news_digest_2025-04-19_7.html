  <div class="theme">
    <h3>4. EU Regulatory Actions and US Trade Relations</h3>

    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> European Union, Apple, Meta, Digital Markets Act, trade talks, US trade policy, fines, penalties</div>

    <h3>7. Shift of COVID-19 Information to Lab Leak Theory</h3>
    <p>The US government's official COVID-19 website, covid.gov, now directs users to a page promoting the lab leak theory, a controversial view on the pandemic's origins. This change sidelines information about testing and vaccines, sparking debates about scientific consensus and public health messaging.</p>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> COVID-19, lab leak theory, covid.gov, White House, public health, conspiracy theory, origins of COVID</div>
