  <h2>Major Themes & Key Trends</h2>
  <!-- Repeat for each theme -->
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. US-Russia Relations and Ukraine Peace Proposals</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Ukraine, Russia, peace deal, sanctions, ceasefire, US diplomacy.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The US is attempting to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine by offering to ease sanctions in exchange for a lasting ceasefire. This could potentially de-escalate the conflict but also raises questions about the long-term stability of the region and the acceptance of territorial concessions by Ukraine. Second-order effects might include shifts in European alliances and energy security strategies.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/us-offers-to-ease-sanctions-on-russia-in-ukraine-peace-proposal">US Offers to Ease Sanctions on Russia in Ukraine Peace Proposal</a></li>

      <li>US proposes a ceasefire that would freeze the conflict and ease sanctions on Moscow.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="theme">
    <h3>2. Escalating Trade Tensions and Economic Warfare</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Tariffs, trade disputes, economic sanctions, US debt, China, Trump tariffs.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The continuation of trade disputes, particularly those involving the US under former President Trump, are creating economic uncertainty. Companies are pulling products from the US market due to rising tariffs, and concerns are rising about the potential for China and Japan to destabilize the US economy by selling US debt. This could lead to increased protectionism, slower global growth, and heightened geopolitical tensions.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/these-companies-have-pulled-out-products-us-due-trumps-tariffs-3770590">These Companies Have Pulled Out Products from the US Due to Trump's Tariffs</a></li>

  <div class="theme">
    <h3>3. Nuclear Deterrence and Arms Control Concerns</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Nuclear war, nuclear deterrence, arms control treaties, Iran nuclear deal, IAEA, Russian propaganda.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Rising tensions, exemplified by aggressive rhetoric from Russian propagandists and concerns over Iran's nuclear program, are increasing the risk of nuclear conflict or proliferation. The failure to secure a deal on Iran's nuclear program and the need to modernize nuclear arsenals are contributing to a more unstable global security environment. This could lead to a renewed arms race and increased regional instability.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/uk-news/what-we-know-uk-nuclear-deterrent-russian-propagandist-warning-914525-20250418">What we know about UK's nuclear war deterrence after Russian propagandist made 'kill all British people' warning</a></li>

    </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="theme">
    <h3>4. NATO Modernization and European Defence Spending</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> NATO, defence modernization, military alliances, European security, Wallonia, infrastructure.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> NATO is investing heavily in modernizing its infrastructure, signalling a commitment to collective defence and adapting to evolving security threats. The €1 billion makeover of NATO's war room in Wallonia reflects a renewed focus on preparedness and technological advancement. This could strengthen deterrence but also potentially escalate tensions with rival powers.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/natos-war-room-in-wallonia-to-get-e1-billion-makeover/">NATO’s war room in Wallonia to get €1 billion makeover</a></li>
      <li>NATO's Cold War-era complex in Mons, Belgium, is expected to get a brand-new building by 2030.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="theme">
    <h3>5. Geopolitical Shifts in Asia: India's Rise and Sri Lanka-India Cooperation</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> India, military power, defence cooperation, Sri Lanka, Modi, MOUs.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> India is projecting itself as a major global power, with ambitions to become a leading military force. Increased defence cooperation between Sri Lanka and India could reshape regional security dynamics and potentially impact relations with other countries in the region. This signifies a shift in the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.</div>

  <div class="theme">
    <h3>6. Economic Challenges and Entrepreneurship in Europe</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> European founders, capital crunch, wars, regulation, trade tensions, policy shifts.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Despite complex conditions including wars, regulation, and capital constraints, young European entrepreneurs are continuing to build businesses. This highlights the resilience of the European economy and the importance of innovation in navigating geopolitical and economic challenges. However, ongoing instability could hinder growth and investment.</div>
    <ul class="examples">

    <div class="theme">
    <h3>7. Energy Security and Geopolitical Resolve in Europe</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Russian gas, energy dilemma, geopolitical resolve, strategic autonomy, German energy firms, French energy firms.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Europe is facing a complex energy dilemma, balancing its need for Russian gas with its geopolitical resolve. Hints that German and French energy firms might resume Russian gas imports signal a quiet recalibration of strategic autonomy. This could lead to a weakening of the united front against Russia, and increased dependence on potentially unreliable energy sources.</div>

    <h3>8. Financial Sanctions and Counter-Terrorism Efforts</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Economic sanctions, financial warfare, Houthis, Yemen, Iran threat network, Treasury, International Bank of Yemen.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The US Department of the Treasury is using financial sanctions to target entities supporting groups like the Houthis, which are considered part of the Iran threat network. This highlights the ongoing use of economic tools to combat terrorism and exert pressure on state and non-state actors. However, the effectiveness of these sanctions and their impact on humanitarian situations remain subjects of debate.</div>
