  <h1>Daily Briefing for 2025-04-19</h1>
  <h2>Key Themes & Analysis</h2>
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Putin's Easter Ceasefire in Ukraine</h3>
    <p>Vladimir Putin declared a temporary Easter ceasefire in Ukraine, set to last from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight Moscow time. This unilateral truce comes amidst ongoing conflict and skepticism from Ukrainian officials who question its sincerity. Russia also completed a POW swap with Ukraine, exchanging hundreds of prisoners.</p>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Putin, Easter ceasefire, Ukraine, Russia, truce, POW swap, Zelenskyy</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The ceasefire's impact on the ground remains uncertain, and it may be a tactical move to gain political leverage or allow Russian forces to regroup.
