  <h2>Major Themes & Key Trends</h2>
  <!-- Repeat for each theme -->
  <div class="theme">
    <h3>1. Ukraine's Shift to Robotic Warfare</h3>
    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Ukraine, robot army, uncrewed ground vehicles, combat robots, frontline replacement.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> Ukraine's increased reliance on robotic warfare could significantly alter the dynamics of the conflict with Russia. This shift raises ethical questions about autonomous weapons and could accelerate the development and deployment of similar technologies by other nations. Second and third-order effects include a potential decrease in human casualties for Ukraine, but an increase in the risk of miscalculation due to reliance on automated systems, and a global arms race in robotic warfare.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2025/04/18/how-ukraine-is-replacing-human-soldiers-with-a-robot-army/">How Ukraine Is Replacing Human Soldiers With A Robot Army</a>: Ukraine will field 15,000 uncrewed ground vehicles this year, including combat robots for assaults.</li>

    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> NATO, Baltic Sea, Russia, naval presence, warships, Sweden, strategic sea.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The bolstered NATO presence in the Baltic Sea, particularly with Sweden's increased naval capabilities, signals a heightened state of readiness and deterrence against potential Russian aggression. This could lead to increased tensions and naval standoffs in the region. Second and third-order effects include potential for accidental escalation, increased military spending by both NATO and Russia, and a shift in regional power dynamics.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-presence-baltic-sea-russia-more-powerful-navies-warships-sweden-2025-4">NATO's presence in a strategic sea it shares with Russia is about to get bigger</a>: NATO countries sharing the strategically important Baltic Sea with Russia have boosted their presence there and are beefing up their navies.</li>

    <div class="keywords"><strong>Keywords:</strong> Chinese hackers, Russian government, Mongolian government, RAT malware, IronHusky, MysterySnail.</div>
    <div class="implications"><strong>Implications:</strong> The targeting of Russian and Mongolian government organizations by Chinese-speaking hackers using upgraded RAT malware indicates ongoing cyber espionage activities between major global powers. This could further strain international relations and lead to retaliatory cyberattacks. Second and third-order effects include increased cybersecurity spending by affected nations, a rise in cyber warfare tactics, and potential disruption of critical infrastructure.</div>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-target-russian-govt-with-upgraded-rat-malware/">Chinese hackers target Russian govt with upgraded RAT malware</a>: Chinese-speaking IronHusky hackers are targeting Russian and Mongolian government organizations using upgraded MysterySnail remote access trojan (RAT) malware.</li>
