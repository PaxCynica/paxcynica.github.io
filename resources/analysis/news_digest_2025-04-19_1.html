  <h2>Analyst’s Guidance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Monitor US-China trade negotiations closely for signs of de-escalation or further escalation, as this will significantly impact global markets.</li>
    <li>Track North Korea's military activities and statements, as well as US responses, for potential flashpoints.</li>
    <li>Follow developments in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly regarding naval deployments and military exercises, to assess the evolving balance of power.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to economic indicators in countries heavily reliant on trade with the US and China, such as South Korea and India, to gauge the impact of tariffs on their economies.</li>
    <li>Keep an eye on reports from organizations like the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) regarding visa revocations and their potential impact on international students and academic institutions.</li>
