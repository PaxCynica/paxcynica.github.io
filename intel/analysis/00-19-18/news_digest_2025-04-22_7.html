    <h3>1. EU Regulations and Standards Impacting Global Tech and Trade</h3>
    <p>The European Union continues to exert its regulatory power, influencing global standards in technology and trade. Recent developments include new labeling requirements for smartphones and tablets to indicate battery life and efficiency, and potential adjustments to methane emission rules for US gas exports to facilitate trade. These actions demonstrate the EU's commitment to consumer transparency and environmental standards, which can create both opportunities and challenges for international businesses.</p>
